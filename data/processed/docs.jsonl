Introduction\nThe human microbiome, an intricate and diverse \necosystem distributed throughout various body \nsites, plays a pivotal role in orchestrating essential \nfunctions that affect both health and disease \nstates.1–4 In recent years, emerging evidence under­\nscores the critical role of the microbiome in carci­\nnogenesis, showing that it is not only implicated in \ntumor development and progression, but also \nserves as a potential biomarker for early detection \nor for progression and treatment resistance in sev­\neral types of cancer.5–7 Additionally, mounting evi­\ndence suggests that the microbiome has been \nshown to modulate the efficacy and toxicity of \ncancer immuno- and chemotherapies.8–13 Being \naware of the dynamic interplay between the \nhuman microbiome in different types of cancer, it \nbecomes necessary to uncover the specific micro­\nbiome interactions and mechanisms to eventually \nimprove treatment efficacy and reduce treatment \ntoxicity.14,15\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is \ncurrently the third most common cause of cancer- \nrelated deaths, and the incidence of this disease has \nbeen steadily increasing by approximately 1% \neach year.16 Despite significant advances in the \ntreatment \nof \nPDAC, \nlike \nthe \npoly- \nchemotherapeutic regimens of FOLFIRINOX \n(5FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and \nthe combination of gemcitabine and a nanoparticle \nalbumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), which \nhave been reported to significantly improve overall \nsurvival, patients still have a poor prognosis with \n5-year survival rates of 10% in the metastatic \nsetting.17–19 This can be attributed to various fac­\ntors (late-stage detection, aggressive tumor growth, \nfrequent metastasis, and primary resistance to stan­\ndard of care).20,21 Also, most of the chemotherapy \nCONTACT Juliana de Castilhos \njuliana.de-castilhos@med.uni-tuebingen.de \nTranslational Microbiome Research, Internal Medicine I and M3 Research \nCenter, University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany\nGUT MICROBES                                              \n2024, VOL. 16, NO. 1, 2374596 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2374596\n© 2024 The Author(s).

The intestinal microbiome \nexerts systemic effects by producing metabolites, \nand thereby modulating the innate and adaptive \nimmune system or metabolic functions of the \nhost. These bacteria can impact the bioavailability \nand metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents, thus \naffecting their efficacy.23,24 Intracellular bacteria \nwithin tumor cells, on the other hand, can directly \ninfluence tumor biology by modulating cell signal­\ning pathways, immune evasion, and drug resis­\ntance. These bacteria might have unique \nadaptations that allow them to survive within the \ntumor microenvironment (TME), potentially alter­\ning the tumor’s response to chemotherapy.25,26 \nTherefore, while intracellular bacteria may have \ndirect effects on tumor cells, intestinal microbiome \nmay modulate the overall treatment response \nthrough indirect systemic effects. Understanding \nthe distinct roles of intratumoral and intestinal \nmicrobiome is crucial for developing comprehen­\nsive therapeutic strategies.\nDespite numerous studies highlighting the \nmicrobiome’s potential to influence drug metabo­\nlism, immune responses, and the TME, there \nremains substantial controversy regarding the \nextent and consistency of these effects. Some stu­\ndies provide compelling evidence that specific bac­\nterial enzymes can activate or deactivate \nchemotherapeutic drugs, thereby impacting their \nefficacy and toxicity. Conversely, other research \nfindings are inconclusive or contradictory, often \ndue to variations in study design, patient popula­\ntions, \nand \nmicrobiome \nanalysis \nmethods. \nUnderstanding these complex and multifaceted \ninteractions is crucial for optimizing therapeutic \noutcomes in PDAC. A comprehensive and \nbalanced examination of the current evidence is \nessential to elucidate the microbiome’s true role \nin chemotherapy efficacy and to identify pathways \nfor future research and clinical application. By \nexploring latest research, this review aims to \nprovide a comprehensive overview of the key \nmechanisms, through which the microbiome \ncould affect chemotherapy efficacy, and it aims to \nhighlight current knowledge gaps. While this \nreview focuses on chemotherapy, we acknowledge \nthat the microbiome’s interactions with immu­\nnotherapy in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are also \ncritical. Therefore, we refer readers to existing \nreviews on microbiome-immunotherapy literature \nin GI cancers for a broader understanding of this \ntopic. In addition, the review will also discuss cut­\nting-edge methodologies, including machine learn­\ning tools, low-biomass microbiome analysis, and \nexperimental models such as patient-derived orga­\nnoids, which are crucial for advancing cancer ther­\napy and diagnosis by providing deeper insights into \nthe intricate interactions between microbes and \ncancer cells. Closing the knowledge gaps to fully \nunderstand the microbial contributions to che­\nmotherapy efficacy holds immense potential for \nadvancing personalized medicine strategies and \nrefining therapeutic approaches to optimize cancer \ntreatments.27\n2. Mechanistic overview: interplay between \nmicrobial metabolism and efficacy of \nchemotherapeutic agents\nCertain bacterial species in the gut can activate or \ndeactivate drugs, influencing their bioavailability \nand therapeutic levels in the body. For instance, \nsome bacteria can convert pro-drugs into their \nactive forms or, conversely, deactivate drugs, redu­\ncing their effectiveness against cancer cells.28,29 The \ngut microbiome is known to impact drug pharma­\ncokinetics \nand \npharmacodynamics, \nnotably \nthrough \nprocesses \nlike \nmetabolism \nand \nelimination.30 In recent research on treatment pro­\ntocols for PDAC, there is a significant focus on the \ninteractions between the tumor, immune cells, and \nthe effects of various therapies, including \nchemotherapy.31,32 Building on the understanding \nof the gut microbiome’s influence on drug efficacy, \nand its role in modulating the effectiveness of \ntherapies, especially in PDAC, the next section \ndelves into the specific mechanisms of microbial \nmetabolism and enzymatic degradation of che­\nmotherapeutic drugs which can contribute to che­\nmotherapy resistance.\n2\nJ. DE CASTILHOS ET AL."}, {"page_number": 4, "text": "2.1. Microbial metabolism and enzymatic \ndegradation: dual forces shaping chemotherapy \nresistance and drug breakdown\nPharmacokinetic research focuses on the micro­\nbiome’s role in xenobiotic metabolism, especially \nregarding therapeutic drugs. Four key factors were \nidentified: (i) enzyme secretion altering drug mole­\ncular structure, (ii) production of metabolites \naffecting drug metabolism, (iii) altering levels and \nfunctions of enzymes in the liver and intestines, \nand (iv) impacting the expression of human meta­\nbolic genes.33,34 Orally administered drugs pass \nthrough the gastrointestinal tract, encountering \nbarriers like physio-chemical properties, transpor­\nters, enzymes, and bacteria, before systemic \nabsorption.30 Gut microbial metabolism adds \nanother layer of complexity, affecting drug bioa­\nvailability and pharmacokinetics.35 After that, \ndrugs are systemically absorbed from intestines, \nor are expelled. They also undergo biliary secretion \nand reabsorption, involving enterohepatic recy­\ncling, a process linked to individual microbiome \ncomposition and drug efficacy.36 The gut micro­\nbiome plays a crucial role in drug efficacy and \nsafety through its enzymatic activities, which can \nmodify the structure, bioactivity, and toxicity of \nmedications.37 Xie et al. (2020) and Zhao et al. \n(2023) identified key enzymatic actions such as \nreduction, cleavage, hydrolysis, and oxidation.37,38 \nThese enzymatic processes modify the biochemical \ncomposition of drugs, thereby impacting their \nbioavailability, efficacy, and toxicity (Table 1).\nAs an example, Lehouritis et al. (2015) explored \nhow gut microbes, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), \naffect the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs like gem­\ncitabine, which is frequently used in PDAC \ntherapy.39 They showed that E. coli significantly \nreduces the effectiveness of gemcitabine and other \nchemotherapeutic agents in vitro. Specifically, \nCT26 tumor-bearing mice treated with gemcita­\nbine plus E. coli displayed significantly increased \ntumor volumes compared to the gemcitabine only \ngroup at multiple time points. These findings sug­\ngest that the presence of certain bacteria in the gut \nand/or within tumors diminishes the anti-tumor \nefficacy of gemcitabine. This interaction between \nbacteria and gemcitabine is mediated by the bac­\nterial enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDD), vital in \nnucleotide metabolism, especially in converting \ncytidine to uridine.40 This enzymatic activity sig­\nnificantly impacts essential cellular processes, \nincluding DNA and RNA synthesis. CDD deacti­\nvates the nucleoside analog gemcitabine by deami­\nnation, transforming it into an inactive form (2’,2’- \ndifluoro-2’deoxyuridine (dFdU)) (Figure 1a), \nthereby substantially reducing the drug’s cytostatic \nproperties. The role of bacteria in mediating gem­\ncitabine resistance, especially through CDD, has \nbeen further investigated in studies by Voorde \n(2014)41 and Geller (2017).8\nIn PDAC, Geller et al. (2017) explored whether \nother bacterial species also confer resistance to \ngemcitabine.8 The authors hypothesized that intra­\ntumoral bacteria might be involved in the che­\nmotherapy \nresistance \nmechanism \nbecause \nTable 1.

(2022).42 This enzyme \nhas been shown to be relevant for irinotecan \ninduced toxicity as it reactivates the prodrug SN- \n38. Notably, the chemotherapeutic agent is \na \ncamptothecin \nderivative \nthat \ncontains \na carbamate group that is deconjugated by \ngmGUS.43 The deconjugated prodrug then leads \nto severe intestinal side effects such as bleeding, \ndiarrhea and acute weight loss44–46,56 (Figure 1b). \nGiven irinotecan’s role in pancreatic cancer treat­\nment, reducing these adverse effects is critical. \nBhatt et al. (2020) conducted a study examining \nthe consequences of inhibiting gmGUS activity. \nTargeted bacterial GUS inhibitors have been \nshown to partially alleviate irinotecan-induced GI \ntract damage and resultant diarrhea.57 Their find­\nings indicated that targeted inhibitors of bacterial \nGUS could significantly mitigate gastrointestinal \ntoxicity caused by enzymatically reactivated pro­\ndrug SN-38. This strategy not only reduced the gut \ndamage induced by irinotecan, but also preserved \nthe drug’s antitumor efficacy. This research pre­\nsents a promising avenue for enhancing cancer \ntreatment by modulating the activity of gut micro­\nbial enzymes.45\nBeyond the deamination of gemcitabine by CDD \nand the deconjugation of the irinotecan prodrug SN- \n38 by gmGUS, knowledge regarding the metabolism \nof chemotherapeutics, particularly those used in \nPDAC therapy, remains limited. However, the \npotential for a drug to be metabolized by gut bacteria \ncan be partially inferred from its chemical structure \nand the presence of functional groups commonly \ntargeted by microbial enzymes. Important consid­\nerations include the specificity of these microbial \nenzymes and the prevalence of microbes that express \nthem. \nFor \nexample, \n5-Fluorouracil \n(5-FU), \na pyrimidine analog, contains a fluorinated pyrimi­\ndine ring, which could potentially be targeted by \nmicrobial enzymes similar to those involved in \nnucleoside metabolism.47 Further, in humans, the \nprotein dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) \nplays a critical role in drug metabolism, as it can \ndetoxify 5-FU through metabolic conversion to \ndihydrofluorouracil (DHFU).48 The microbial strain \nE. coli was also shown to possess a functional homo­\nlog that can catalyze the conversion of uracil into \n5,6-dihydrouracil in vivo.49 By identifying equiva­\nlents between known human and microbial \nmechanisms, potential metabolic reactions can be \npredicted in silico.\nAnother commonly used drug in the treatment \nof PDAC is oxaliplatin. This chemotherapeutic \nagent is a platinum-based compound with \na \n1,2-diaminocyclohexane \n(DACH) \ncarrier \nligand.50 To the best of our knowledge, there are \nno bacterial enzymes currently described that \ncould alter the chemical structure of platinum- \nbased drugs. This suggests that oxaliplatin is less \nlikely to undergo significant microbial metabolism \ndue to the absence of common microbial enzyme \ntargets. Although direct metabolism by the micro­\nbiome might be limited, the gut microbiome can \ninfluence the efficacy and toxicity of oxaliplatin \nthrough indirect mechanisms. For example, the \nmicrobiome can modulate the host’s immune sys­\ntem, which in turn can affect the response to \noxaliplatin.2,58 Certain gut microbes may enhance \nor diminish the drug’s effectiveness by modulating \ninflammatory responses or by influencing the \nintegrity of the gut barrier, which can affect drug \nabsorption and systemic availability.\nPaclitaxel is utilized in the treatment of PDAC \nas part of a combination chemotherapy regimens \n(usually together with gemcitabine), to enhance \ntherapeutic outcomes and improve patient \nsurvival.59 This chemotherapeutic agent is \na diterpenoid pseudoalkaloid with a complex \nstructure comprising a taxane ring and an ester \nside chain.51 The ester bond in paclitaxel is sus­\nceptible to hydrolysis by bacterial esterases, which \nmay alter the drug’s activity.52 Additionally, pacli­\ntaxel is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes \nin the liver.53,54 Given that cytochrome P450 \nGUT MICROBES\n5"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "enzymes are produced by both eukaryotes and \nprokaryotes, the presence of P450 enzyme- \nproducing microbes could contribute to the \nmetabolism of paclitaxel.55\nAlso, enterohepatic circulation, crucial in \nextending the pharmacological effects of certain \ndrugs and their metabolites through biliary secre­\ntion and intestinal reabsorption, plays another sig­\nnificant role in drug bioavailability.60 Biliary \nsecretion, primarily a drug elimination process, \ninvolves making drugs or their metabolites hydro­\nphilic through glucuronidation, and reducing their \nreabsorbability.30 The gut microbiome, with its \narray of glucuronidase enzymes,61 can deconjugate \nthese drugs, thereby modulating systemic exposure \nto both the drug and its metabolites62 (Figure 1c).\nIn addition to the direct interaction between \nchemotherapeutic agents and bacterial enzymes, \nwhich can alter chemotherapy efficacy, the micro­\nbiome can indirectly influence drug effectiveness \nby modulating immune responses and regulating \neukaryotic signaling pathways. To broaden the \nscope of strategies for preventing chemoresistance, \nit is essential to focus on understanding these intri­\ncate microbe-host interactions. For example, β- \nglucosidase, an enzyme integral to numerous bio­\nlogical processes, particularly in the breakdown of \ncomplex carbohydrates, is produced by various \nbacteria, including lactic acid-producing bacteria \nin the human gut. The enzyme’s activities are cru­\ncial in different biochemical pathways, as outlined \nby Michlmayr and Kneifel (2014).63 In cancer, β- \nglucosidase can play a role in tumor growth.64 \nWhile β-glucosidase itself is not directly linked to \nchemotherapeutic drug metabolism in PDAC, its \nrole in the broader context of glycoside metabolism \ncan indirectly affect the efficacy of treatments, \nespecially those involving glycoside-based pro­\ndrugs. The expression and activity of the enzyme β- \nglucosidase are notably increased in breast cancer \ntissues and cell lines as identified by Zhou et al. \n(2017).64 This upregulation activates the PI3K/Akt/ \nmTOR signaling pathway, which contributes to \nenhanced cell growth (Figure 1d). Inhibition of \nthe β-glucosidase was shown to significantly sensi­\ntize breast cancer cells to chemotherapy both \nin vitro and in vivo64, and might alleviate chemore­\nsistance to 5-FU in gastric cancer.65 This research \nunderscores a dual role and importance of β- \nglucosidase in cancer progression and its \ntreatment.\nIn summary, the intricate interplay between \nmicrobial metabolism and enzymatic degradation \nsignificantly impacts the efficacy and resistance of \nchemotherapeutic agents. Our review underscores \nthe necessity of considering the microbiome’s role \nin drug metabolism, highlighting the dual forces of \nbacterial enzyme activities and host-microbiome \ninteractions. While several mechanisms of bacterial \nmetabolism of chemotherapeutics have been \nuncovered, their applicability to PDAC remains is \nstill unknown. Unraveling these mechanisms in \nPDAC could offer valuable insights for refining \nchemotherapy strategies and enhancing patient \nprognosis.\n2.2. Bacterial metabolites: impact on \nchemotherapy efficacy and tumor progression\nThe fundamental role of microbial metabolites, and \nits complex assembly called the metabolome, in \nshaping physiological and pathological host func­\ntions, has already been recognized for many years, \nbut only recently gained increased attention with \nadvances of new “omics” technologies.66,67 These \ndevelopments have uncovered the vast diversity of \nthe metabolome, both between different indivi­\nduals and within the same individual over time. \nThis diversity is particularly important in \na clinical context, as it might affect chemotherapy \nmetabolisms and toxicity.68 Understanding these \ncomplex interactions between microbial metabo­\nlites and host functions is crucial for advancing \npersonalized medicine and improving drug efficacy \nand safety.\nGut microbiota-derived metabolites are crucial \nin connecting the gut microbiome to cancer pro­\ngression, modulating the effectiveness of che­\nmotherapy drugs either by working synergistically \nto enhance the therapeutic effects or by inducing \nresistance. They can remodel the TME and regulate \nkey signaling pathways in both cancer cells and \nimmune cells.69 Within this environment, immune \nand inflammatory responses are predominantly \ndriven by immune cells and cytokines, and micro­\nbial metabolites play a crucial role in modulating \nthese responses which we will discuss in the follow­\ning paragraph70:\n6\nJ. DE CASTILHOS ET AL."}, {"page_number": 8, "text": "Postler et al. (2017) classified microbial metabo­\nlites into three types: (1) Those derived directly \nfrom dietary components, like indole derivatives \nand short chain fatty acids (SCFAs); (2) host meta­\nbolites modified by gut microbiota, such as second­\nary bile acids; and (3) metabolites synthesized by \nmicrobes, for example, polysaccharide A.71 SCFAs, \nparticularly butyrate, play vital roles in host phy­\nsiology as signaling molecules, regulators of cellular \nmetabolism, \nand \nmodulators \nof \nimmune \nresponses.1,72 They can enter cells directly via dif­\nfusion \nor \ncarrier-mediated \ntransport.73 \nAdditionally, some SCFAs functions involve bind­\ning to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), \nincluding free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), \nFFAR3, and G-protein-coupled receptor 109a \n(GPR109a). Butyrate can act synergistically with \nchemotherapy drugs by inhibiting histone deacety­\nlases (HDACs). This inhibition leads to increased \nhistone acetylation, which affects the expression of \ngenes involved in cell cycle regulation and apopto­\nsis. Butyrate, in particular, has been shown to sen­\nsitize cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced \napoptosis by modulating the expression of pro- \napoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. This modu­\nlation enhances the therapeutic effects of drugs like \nirinotecan, doxorubicin, and adriamycin in color­\nectal cancer (CRC), multiple myeloma, and uterine \ncancers, respectively.74–80 Additionally, in gastric \ncancer, butyrate enhances the effects of cisplatin \nby increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) within \ncells, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential \n(MMP), and inhibiting cell invasion and migration \ncapabilities.74,81 On the other hand, butyrate has \nthe ability to directly interfere with oncogenic sig­\nnaling pathways, e.g., the JAK2/STAT3, vascular \nendothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Wnt \npathways.82,83 By downregulating VEGF expres­\nsion, for example, butyrate reduces angiogenesis, \na critical process for tumor growth and metastasis. \nIn addition, butyrate promotes the differentiation \nof cancer cells through the protein kinase C (PKC) \npathway, making them more susceptible to \nchemotherapy.82–84 The combined effects of buty­\nrate on histone modification, signaling pathways, \nand cellular differentiation make it multifaceted \nadjuvant in chemotherapy regimens.\nVarious studies have also investigated the impact \nof butyrate on pancreatic cancer cells. Its effects \nrange from anti-proliferative effects, as highlighted \nby Bloom et al. (1989), Gaschott et al. (2001), \nNatoni et al. (2005), and Sanaei et al. (2022),85–88 \nto anti-invasive properties noted by Farrow et al. \n(2003).89 Additionally, its capability to enhance the \nefficacy of anticancer drugs has been demon­\nstrated, as detailed in studies by Kitazono et al. \n(2010)90 and Panebianco et al. (2022).91 A critical \naspect of butyrate’s action, particularly relevant in \nthe context of chemotherapy resistance, is its inter­\naction with the p53 protein. Pellegata (1994) sug­\ngested that the absence of functional p53 protein \ncontributes to chemotherapy resistance.92 Kitazono \net al. (2010) found that it can induce histone acet­\nylation and the expression of the tumor-suppressor \np53 in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines lack­\ning functional p5393 (Figure 1e). Moreover, they \nobserved that combining butyrate with anticancer \ndrugs like cisplatin and fluorouracil enhanced their \neffects. This discovery suggests new therapeutic \nstrategies, especially for tumors with compromised \np53 function, potentially addressing a key chal­\nlenge in chemotherapy resistance. Panebianco \net al. (2022) further explored the synergistic effects \nof butyrate and gemcitabine.91 Their research indi­\ncated enhanced drug efficacy in pancreatic cancer \ncell lines (human PxPC-3 and PANC-1) and xeno­\ngraft mouse models when using a combination of \nthese compounds, compared to gemcitabine alone. \nThey observed that this combination not only \ninhibited cell growth but also intensified gemcita­\nbine-induced \napoptosis \nin \ncell \ncultures. \nAdditionally, in mice, the combined treatment \ninfluenced the gut microbiome diversity, structure, \nand function, along with changes in the metabo­\nlome and lipidome. These changes included \nreduced levels of fatty acid amides and hydroxy­\nlated fatty acid metabolites, potentially impacting \ncancer metabolism and progression.\nThe microbial metabolite class of urolithins have \nalso been linked to chemotherapy efficacy. They are \nderivatives of dibenzopyran-6-one produced gut \nmicrobes after consuming ellagitannin (ET)-rich \nfoods like nuts, pomegranates, and berries. \nMicrobes hydrolyzes ET to form ellagic acid (EA), \nwhich is then converted into urolithin A (UA) and \nurolithin B (UB) through processes of lactone-ring \ncleavage, decarboxylation, and dihydroxylation.94– \n96 Urolithin A improves the efficacy of 5-FU by \nGUT MICROBES\n7"}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "modulating drug resistance pathways and reducing \nthe expression of multidrug resistance proteins. \nUrolithin A (UA) can modulate of the forkhead \nbox O3-forkhead box M1 axis, which leads to \ndecreased expression of multi-drug resistance pro­\nteins (MRP) 2 and MRP7 on the cancer cell surface, \nthereby reducing the efflux of chemotherapy drugs \nin CRC, for instance.97 Similarly, UA downregu­\nlates breast cancer resistance protein, allowing \nmitoxantrone to remain in cancer cells longer, \nincreasing its efficacy.98 On the other hand, uro­\nlithin B increases the toxicity of cisplatin and pacli­\ntaxel in esophageal cancer, although the exact \nmechanism remains unclear.94 These examples \nillustrate the potential of gut microbiome-derived \nmetabolites to synergistically enhance or decrease \nchemotherapy efficacy through various mechan­\nisms, including immune and epigenetic regulation.\nIn patients with PDAC, significant alterations in \nthe microbiome and bacterial metabolome are \nobserved with distinct variations between long- \nand short-term survivors. Riquelme et al. (2019) \nand Kiss et al. (2020) identified differing microbial \nprofiles in these two groups.99,100 Building on this, \nTintelnot et al. (2023) explored the relationship \nbetween treatment response and the gut micro­\nbiome in PDAC patients.101 They discovered \na marked difference in the concentration of 3-indo­\nleacetic acid (3-IAA) between patients responding \nand not responding to the FOLFIRINOX regimen. \nHigher levels of 3-IAA were found in patients and \nmice that showed a better response to this treat­\nment. 3-IAA is synthesized from tryptophan by the \nintestinal \nmicrobiome \nusing \nthe \nenzyme \ntryptophanase.102,103 Tintelnot et al. demonstrated \nthat 3-IAA enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy \nin PDAC.101 The key mechanism involves the \nenzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), predominantly \nfound in neutrophils, which oxidizes 3-IAA to pro­\nduce ROS. The high ROS levels, induced by the \nMPO-mediated oxidation of 3-IAA, impair cancer \ncell stress adaptation mechanisms, particularly \nautophagy, leading to reduced cell proliferation \nand increased apoptosis (Figure 1f). In humanized \ngnotobiotic mouse models of PDAC, administra­\ntion of 3-IAA along with chemotherapy signifi­\ncantly reduced tumor weight and improved \ntreatment outcomes. This was further demon­\nstrated by decreased tumor growth in mice \ncolonized with responder microbiomes when trea­\nted with chemotherapy and 3-IAA.101 The study \nunderscores the potential of microbiome-derived \nmetabolites to augment the effectiveness of existing \ncancer therapies. While 3-IAA shows promising \nsynergy with chemotherapy, there are caveats as \nindoles or other tryptophan metabolites can impair \nanti-tumor immune responses through the aryl \nhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in PDAC.101,104 \nHigh AhR expression in human PDAC samples is \nassociated with rapid disease progression and an \nimmune-suppressive tumor microenvironment.105 \nAlso, the beneficial effects of 3-IAA are highly \ndependent on the presence of MPO in neutrophils \nand neutrophil infiltration in tumors.101,106 This \nindicates that the effectiveness of 3-IAA could \nvary based on the patient’s immune cell profile \nand the specific tumor microenvironment.\nIn their research on the association between \npoor survival, therapy resistance in obese pan­\ncreatic cancer patients, and microbial metabo­\nlites, Kesh et al. (2022) focused on two \nmicrobial \nmetabolites: \nQueuosine \nand \nS-adenosylmethionine (SAM).107 Queuosine, \na bacterial t-RNA homolog, has been noted for \nits role in inhibiting cell proliferation and reg­\nulating metabolism.108 It is also linked to the \ninduction of PRDX1, an antioxidant protein that \nprotects \ntumor \ncells \nfrom \nchemotherapy \ninduced \noxidative \nstress107 \n(Figure \n1g). \nConversely, SAM is recognized for its anti- \ntumor properties, such as reversing the hypo­\nmethylation of oncogenes like c-myc and H-ras \nin gastric and colon cancers,109 and enhancing \nthe efficacy of doxorubicin in breast cancer \ncells110 (Figure 1h). Kesh et al. analyzed the \ngut microbiome in obese mice resistant to gem­\ncitabine \nand \npaclitaxel.107 \nThey \nfound \na significant presence of bacteria producing \nqueuosine in resistant mice with obesity, while \nlean, nonresistant mice had an enrichment of \nbacteria producing SAM. Supplementing obese \nanimals with SAM sensitized pancreatic tumors \nto chemotherapy, and treating pancreatic cancer \ncells with queuosine increased PRDX1 expres­\nsion. Additionally, tumors in obese mice had an \nincrease in CD133+ treatment refractory pan­\ncreatic tumor populations compared to controls. \nThe study revealed that queuosine accumulation \n8\nJ.

(2009) and Kaddurah-Daouk et al. \n(2011).111,112 Secondary bile acids, which are \nproducts of bacterial bile metabolism and mod­\nification, play a critical role in various diseases, \nincluding \nClostridioides \ndifficile \ninfection, \ninflammatory \nbowel \ndisease, \nmetabolic \ndiseases,113 and cancer.114 These bile acids are \nkey in determining drug absorption from the \nintestine due to their involvement in drug solu­\nbilization, maintenance of supersaturation, \nmodulation of lipase activity, and effects on \nthe partitioning of ionized drugs. Additionally, \nthey influence membrane permeability by affect­\ning transporters and tight junctions.115 Malhotra \net al.

Recent advances in ”omics” \ntechnologies have uncovered the vast diversity of the \nmetabolome, shedding light on how these metabolites \naffect drug metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity. \nRecognizing the interactions between microbial \nmetabolites and host functions is crucial for pushing \nthe boundaries of personalized medicine, with the \npotential to significantly improve therapeutic out­\ncomes and patient prognoses.\n2.3. Intersections of the microbiome, immune cell \ndynamics, and tumor microenvironment in \nchemotherapy response\nThe efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy are not \nonly influenced by bacterial enzymes and metabo­\nlites, but also by immune regulations. The gut \nmicrobiome plays a crucial role in modulating the \nhost’s immune response and is integral to the \ndevelopment and education of the immune \nsystem.2 This modulation includes shaping the \nabundance, differentiation and activity of various \nimmune cell populations, such as T cells, B cells, \nand antigen-presenting cells.119–121 For example, \nregulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial in maintaining \nimmune homeostasis but can also create an immu­\nnosuppressive TME that “protects” cancer cells. \nTregs suppress anti-tumor immune responses by \nproducing inhibitory cytokines like TGF-β, IL-10, \nand IL-35.122 Certain bacterial species can induce \nthe development of Tregs, which further enhances \nthis immunosuppressive environment, e.g., by sup­\npressing effector T cell activity, and helps the \ntumor evade immune surveillance.123 Clinically, \nthe presence of Tregs in the TME is associated \nwith poor prognosis and reduced effectiveness of \nchemotherapy.122,124\nAlthough many organs exhibit a diverse immune \nenvironment,2 PDAC presents a unique tumor \nentity as it is an immunologically “cold” tumor, \npossessing an immunosuppressive microenviron­\nment. This characteristic, detailed by Gautam et al. \n(2023), contributes significantly to the poor \nresponse to therapies observed in PDAC.125 \nPushalkar et al. (2018) linked these differences to \nimmune suppression and carcinogenesis demon­\nstrating that bacterial removal from cancerous pan­\ncreas tissue leads to immunological reprogramming \ninvolving a decrease in myeloid-derived suppressor \ncells and an increase in CD8+ T cell activation126 \n(Figure 1j). Further research by Riquelme et al. \n(2019) indicated that the tumor microbiome in \nlong-term survivors of pancreatic cancer aids \nT-cell activation.99 This is associated with the pre­\nsence of specific bacterial genera such as \nSaccharopolyspora, \nPseudoxanthomonas, \nand \nStreptomyces within the tumor (Figure 1k).

In che­\nmotherapy, some evidence emphasized the immu­\nnomodulatory effects of certain bacterial strains on \ntreatment efficacy. Viaud et al. (2013) noted \na modulation of immune cell populations and acti­\nvation of pro-inflammatory genes vital for immune \nsystem stimulation after 48 hours following therapy \nwith non-myeloablative doses of cyclophosphamide \nor the anthracycline doxorubicin in naive mice.9 \nThis research underscores the importance of micro­\nbiome immunomodulation in cyclophosphamide \ntreatments for PDAC. Cyclophosphamide is \nknown not only for its direct anticancer properties, \nbut also for its ability to stimulate anti-tumor \nimmune responses, which can significantly enhance \ntherapeutic efficacy.127,128 Viaud et al. (2013) speci­\nfically identified the role of certain gram-positive \ncommensals, including Lactobacillus johnsonii, \nLactobacillus murinus, and Enterococcus hirae, in \nboosting T helper 17 (Th17) and T helper 1 (Th1) \ncells, crucial in cancer growth control9 (Figure 1l). \nIn studies involving MCA205 sarcoma-bearing \nmice, the use of vancomycin, which targets gram- \npositive bacteria, resulted in a reduced Th17 cell \nresponse and diminished the anti-tumor efficacy of \ncyclophosphamide.9 Further expanding on this, \nDaillere et al. (2016) discovered that cyclophospha­\nmide’s immunomodulatory effects against cancer \nalso involve the gram-negative strain Barnesiella \nintestinihominis. This bacteria aids in the recruit­\nment of IFN-γ-producing γδ T cells into tumors10 \n(Figure 1m). These findings collectively indicate that \nboth gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria \nwithin the gut microbiome are key players in mod­\nulating the immune response during cyclophospha­\nmide treatment for cancer.\nA diverse and balanced microbiome is associated \nwith better health outcomes and survival.99 \nHowever, chemotherapy can also lead to dysbiosis, \na microbial imbalance in the gastrointestinal tract, \nimpacting immune response and chemotherapy \neffectiveness. Research, including studies by Lin \net al. (2012), Montassier et al. (2015), Levy et al. \n(2017), Deleemans et al. (2019), Galloway-Pena \net al. (2020), Rajagopala et al. (2020) and Wei \net al. (2021), demonstrates that chemotherapy \nreduces microbiome diversity in feces of both \nanimals and humans.129–135 Specific changes in \nbacterial \nspecies \nhave \nbeen \nnoted \npost- \nchemotherapy, such as the decrease in Firmicutes \nand Actinobacteria and increase in Proteobacteria \nobserved by Montassier et al. (2015) in non- \nHodgkin’s lymphoma patients.130 They also \nreported genus-level alterations, with bacteria \nlinked to reduced inflammation decreasing and \nthose associated with colitis increasing.\nAlthough several studies highlight a significant \nshift in the abundance of individual bacterial species \ninduced by chemotherapy, the specific effects of \ngemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX (two of the most \nused chemotherapy regimens in PDAC) on the gut \nmicrobiome during pancreatic cancer treatment are \nnot fully understood. The impact of chemotherapy \non the gut microbiome can be different between \nindividuals, and influenced by factors such as the \ntype of chemotherapy, treatment duration, and the \nindividual’s baseline microbiome.136,137 Therefore, \nthese microbial changes induced by chemotherapy \nimpact: 1) the efficacy of chemotherapy by displa­\ncing beneficial bacterial species; 2) the side effects of \ntreatment, such as chemotherapy-induced intestinal \nmucositis, by altering intestinal barrier function; \nand 3) immune modulation and function, poten­\ntially leading to dysregulation and an increased risk \nof infections.130,131,138 Disruption of this balance can \nresult in immune dysregulation, thereby increasing \nthe risk of infections diminishing the immune sys­\ntem’s efficacy against cancer cells and other \nthreats.135\nThe gut microbiome is not only key to regulating \nimmune responses, but also affects the success and \nside effects of chemotherapy drugs. Despite signif­\nicant advances already made in this area, the inter­\nactions between the microbiome, immune system, \nand chemotherapeutic agents are highly complex \nand not fully understood. For example, the inter­\nactions between oxaliplatin, the epithelium, and \nthe immune response in chemotherapy are highly \ncomplex and multifaceted. Oxaliplatin induces \nimmunogenic cell death (ICD) in intestinal epithe­\nlial cells (IECs), particularly affecting the ileal \ncrypts, which is critical for activating the immune \nresponse against colon cancer.58 The apoptosis of \nIECs triggers the release of damage-associated \nmolecular patterns (DAMPs) that recruit and \n10\nJ.

Understanding the \ninterplay between the gut microbiome, immune \nresponse, and TME is pivotal in developing more \neffective therapeutic strategies for PDAC and other \ncancers.\n2.4. The microbiome’s role in mediating \nchemotherapy toxicity and side effects\nChemotherapy, a long-standing cornerstone of \ncancer treatment, often leads to side effects such \nas diarrhea, mucositis, anemia, easy bruising, and \nhair loss, significantly impacting patients’ quality of \nlife.139,140 Although not studied extensively, an \nincreasing number of studies suggest a gut micro­\nbiome’s role in modulating the severity of these \nchemotherapy-induced toxicities.\nThe gut microbiome influences drug metabo­\nlism, and changes in its composition may alter the \ntoxicity profile of drugs. As reviewed by Lo et al. \n(2023), the microbiome, particularly butyrate- \nproducing bacteria, has been shown to mitigate \n5-FUinduced toxicity by suppressing mucositis \nand diarrhea.141 Species like Akkermansia mucini­\nphila and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum have been \nidentified for their ability to suppress 5-FU- \ninduced side effects through mechanisms such as \nrestoring intestinal barrier function and suppres­\nsing \neosinophil \nperoxidase \nand \nMPO \nactivities.142,143 Furthermore, bacteria producing \ngmGUS can increase irinotecan toxicity, particu­\nlarly diarrhea, by reactivating the prodrug SN- \n38.56,57 Chemotherapy drugs also can damage the \nmucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, causing \nmucositis.144,145 A healthy microbiome contributes \nto gut barrier integrity and can offer protection \nagainst mucosal damage.146 Lastly, the altered \nactivity and expression of drug-metabolizing \nenzymes, which depend on microbial expression, \nare key in chemotherapy-induced toxicity.147 The \ncomposition and activity of the microbiome are \nthus crucial factors in managing the side effects of \nchemotherapy.\nTo date, there have been no additional studies \nspecifically identifying the role of the microbiome \nin \ntoxicities \ninduced \nby \ngemcitabine \nor \nFOLFIRINOX in PDAC patients. This gap in \nresearch highlights a significant area for future \ninvestigation. The existing evidence that the micro­\nbiome can either suppress or exacerbate che­\nmotherapy induced toxicity underscores the need \nfor more studies to understand its specific role in \nthe context of PDAC treatment. Understanding the \nmicrobiome’s interaction with chemotherapeutic \nagents, especially in PDAC, could be crucial for \ndeveloping strategies to mitigate adverse effects. \nBy leveraging this knowledge, medical profes­\nsionals could aim to restore or preserve a healthy \nmicrobiome, thereby potentially reducing treat­\nment-related toxicities. This approach could lead \nto improved patient outcomes, not only in terms of \ncancer management but also in enhancing overall \nquality of life during treatment.\n3. Translational approaches: from laboratory \nresearch to clinical application\nThe advancement of precision medicine under­\nscores the importance of the microbiome as \na critical factor and a new potential target to \nenhance the efficacy and safety of patient-specific \ntreatments. This approach is particularly relevant \ndue to the notable inter-individual variability \nobserved \nin \nresponses \nto \npharmacological \ntreatments.148 The role of the gut microbiome in \ndrug \nmetabolism, \ninitially \nrecognized \nin \nPeppercorn and Goldman’s work in 1972,149 has \nbeen further illuminated with the emergence of \n’pharmacomicrobiomics’.

Microbes and metabolites as predictive \nbiomarkers\nThe expanding area of microbiome research in \nPDAC underscores the pivotal role of the micro­\nbiome in shaping patient prognosis and treatment \nresponses. Despite advances in understanding the \nmicrobiome’s influence in other cancers, PDAC \nlacks reliable biomarkers for predicting drug effi­\ncacy, often due to late-stage diagnosis and \nadvanced tumor progression.14 Therefore, there is \na critical need for research that identifies changes \nin the intestinal microbiome and correlates them \nwith clinical outcomes at various stages of PDAC \ndevelopment. Some preclinical studies have estab­\nlished the mechanistic foundation for compre­\nhending the microbiome’s impact on cancer \ntherapy, with human association studies reinfor­\ncing these findings by correlating specific microbial \npatterns with treatment responses, prognosis, and \nthe incidence of adverse effects.151 Nevertheless, \nfurther studies are essential to understand these \nassociations and their potential implications for \nearly detection and treatment strategies.\nThe study by Mendez et al. (2019) investigates \nthe potential of the gut microbiome and its meta­\nbolic products as early detection tools for PDAC.152 \nUsing a genetically engineered PDAC murine \nmodel, the study analyzes gut fecal microbiome \nthrough 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and whole- \ngenome \nsequencing. \nThe \nresults \nrevealed \na dominance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in \ngut microbiome during the early stages of PDAC. \nMetabolic reconstruction showed an increase in \npolyamine and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways, \nwhich are assimilated by the host and utilized by \nrapidly dividing cells, signifying their role in \ntumorigenesis. Elevated serum polyamine levels in \nboth mice and PDAC patients were observed, sug­\ngesting a strong correlation between microbial \nchanges and metabolites fostering tumorigenesis. \nThis study proposes the potential of microbial \nalterations and metabolites as noninvasive tools \nfor early PDAC detection, which could improve \npatient outcomes.\nThe study by Nagata et al.

Regulating the gut microbiome: insights into \ntherapeutic interventions\nCurrently, there is a spectrum of multifaceted \napproaches directed toward the modulation of the \ngut microbiome, encompassing a diverse array of \nstrategies. These strategies include microbial \nmanipulation via dietary alterations (such as pro­\nbiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics) and antibiotics. In \nthe context of PDAC, there are relatively few stu­\ndies, but those that exist offer intriguing and poten­\ntially significant conclusions.\n3.2.1. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics\nThe intricate relationship between the gut micro­\nbiome and cancer has garnered significant attention \nin recent years, particularly regarding the roles of \nprebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics. These inter­\nventions hold promise for modulating the immune \nsystem and improving therapeutic outcomes in var­\nious malignancies, including PDAC. To provide \na clear understanding of these concepts, Table 2 \nsummarizes the definitions, examples, mechanisms \nof action, and potential benefits of prebiotics, pro­\nbiotics, and synbiotics in the cancer context.\nProbiotics, defined as live microorganisms that \nprovide health benefits when administered in ade­\nquate amounts, have shown promising results in \nimmunomodulation in both preclinical models and \ncancer patients (Figure 2c). Chen et al.

Antibiotics\nSystemic antibiotics have demonstrated promising \nantitumoral effects in various preclinical models, \nsuggesting a potential link between microbiome \nmodulation and cancer progression. Key studies \nin this domain include those by Thomas et al. \n(2018), Sethi et al. (2018) and Pushalkar et al. \n(2020), which explore the relationship between \nthe microbiome and tumor development in differ­\nent cancer types, including PDAC.126,183,184 For \nexample, Pushalkar et al. discovered that the abla­\ntion of the microbiota using an antibiotic cocktail \nconsisting of vancomycin, neomycin, metronida­\nzole, and amphotericin significantly enhanced the \neffectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade \n(ICB) in the treatment of PDAC in a mouse \nmodel. The study reported that the removal of the \nmicrobiome suppressed the development of both \npre-invasive and invasive PDAC. However, trans­\nferring bacteria from tumor-bearing hosts pro­\nmoted tumor growth. The elimination of bacteria \nwas linked to an immunogenic reprogramming of \nthe TME in PDAC. This included a decrease in \nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and an \nincrease in M1 macrophages, leading to the Th1 \ndifferentiation of CD4+ T cells and activation of \nCD8+ T cells. These findings suggest that endogen­\nous microbes contribute to the immunosuppressive \nTME in PDAC, and that microbial ablation could \nbe a promising strategy to inhibit PDAC \nprogression126 (Figure 2f). Although numerous \nstudies have demonstrated the effects of antibiotics \nin microbiome modulation using immunothera­\npies, the impact of these interventions on human \npancreatic conditions, particularly in the context of \nchemotherapy and PDAC, remains unclear, under \nexplored, and the results are still controversial.\nWeniger et al.

In conclusion, this \nstudy highlights the potential role of specific \nmicrobiome, especially K. pneumoniae, in che­\nmoresistance and underscores the promise of tar­\ngeted antibiotic treatment in PDAC management.\nFulop et al.

Non- \npenicillin β-lactams were associated with an 11% \nreduction in the risk of death (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, \n0.810.97; p = 0.01) compared to all other antibiotic \nclasses, whereas fluoroquinolones alone were not \nassociated with a difference in overall survival (HR, \n1.00; 95% CI, 0.93–1.12; p = 0.70). Propensity- \nmatched analysis revealed that antibiotic use was \nalso associated with a 16% improvement in cancer- \nspecific survival among gemcitabine-treated \npatients. However, no significant survival benefit \nwas observed for antibiotic use in fluorouracil- \ntreated patients. These findings underscore the \npotential role of antibiotics in modulating bacteria- \nmediated gemcitabine resistance, suggesting that \nstrategic antibiotic use could enhance the efficacy \nof chemotherapy and improve patient outcomes in \nmetastatic PDAC.\nAnother retrospective study of PDAC patients \nrevealed that over 60% of those who underwent \nresection or had metastatic disease used antibiotics. \nThe frequency of antibiotic use from diagnosis to \ndeath or the date of the last follow-up was 82% (n =  \n195), while forty-three patients (18%) did not \nreceive any antibiotics. The following antibiotics \nwere received by the resected PDAC patients: qui­\nnolones (n = 168), βlactams (n = 80), nitroimida­\nzoles (n = 48), glycopeptides (n = 32), tetracyclines \n(n = 18), macrolides (n = 14), and sulfa drugs (n =  \n4).187 This group, when compared to those not \nexposed to antibiotics, showed increased OS of \n13.3 months versus 9.0 months, and PFS of 4.4  \nmonths compared to 2 months in metastatic \ncases. Additionally, antibiotic use has been linked \nto enhanced effectiveness of gemcitabine-based \ntreatments for PDAC.188,189\nThese findings collectively suggest that strategic \nantibiotic use could be a promising adjunct to \nenhance chemotherapy efficacy and improve out­\ncomes in metastatic PDAC.

Advancing microbiome research in \npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: overcoming \ncurrent challenges\nThe horizon of cancer therapies has witnessed the \nemergence of novel insights and investigations \npoised to serve as alternative approaches. Among \nthese promising avenues are fecal microbiota trans­\nplantation (FMT), the development of engineered \nmicrobial consortia, and personalized phage \ntherapy.8,12,190,191 These innovations shed light \nupon their evolving roles in the reconfiguration of \nthe gut microbiome landscape and their potential \nramifications within the sphere of cancer treat­\nment. However, many of these alternatives have \nnot yet been tested for PDAC, and therefore the \narea still lacks more research and innovation. As we \ndelve into the evolving landscape of PDAC \nresearch and treatment, several pioneering \napproaches are emerging that have the potential \nto reshape our understanding and management of \nthis challenging disease. These include the devel­\nopment and application of machine learning mod­\nels for early detection, the intricate analysis of low- \nbiomass microbiomes in cancer tissues, and the \nexploration of microbe-host interactions through \nGUT MICROBES\n17"}, {"page_number": 19, "text": "advanced model systems. We will explore these \ntopics in detail in the upcoming sections.\n4.1. Machine learning tools for early cancer \ndetection and treatment prediction\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence and particu­\nlarly machine learning algorithms are becoming \nincreasingly important in the field of biology and \nmicrobiome studies, particularly in complex \ndisorders.192 These technologies enable detailed \nanalysis of very large datasets from microbiome \nresearch, revealing insights in an unsupervised \nand supervised manners. Machine learning meth­\nods are crucial for integrating largescale micro­\nbiome data with clinical and molecular features, \nin order to predict tumor development, progres­\nsion, and response to treatment. Thereby, these \nmethods can aid in implementing personalized \ntreatment strategies.\nSeveral recent publications show the successful \nusage of machine learning algorithms for predict­\ning PDAC prognosis. For example, the work by \nJia et al. (2023) focused on developing \na pancreatic cancer risk prediction model \n(Prism) using Electronic Health Record (EHR) \ndata \nfrom \na \nmulti-institutional \nfederated \nnetwork.193 This model aimed at early detection \nof PDAC 6–18 months before diagnosis. The pre­\ndiction model, including deep neural network- \nbased model coined PrismNN and a variation of \nlinear model PrismLR, was developed using data \nfrom 55 US Health Care Organizations, targeting \npatients aged 40 years or older. The study found \nPrism models to have good accuracy and general­\nizability across different populations, suggesting \ntheir potential utility in early PDAC detection, \nthus expanding the scope of current screening \nguidelines.193 In another approach, Placido et al. \n(2023) focuses on developing a deep learning \nalgorithm to predict the risk of PDAC from dis­\nease trajectories.194 The study utilized clinical \ndata from millions of patients in Denmark and \nthe US to train machine learning models on \nsequences of disease codes in clinical histories. \nThese models were used to predict cancer occur­\nrence within various time windows. The best- \nperforming model demonstrated high predictive \naccuracy, highlighting the potential of this \ntechnology in early cancer detection and surveil­\nlance program design.194 Another work by Cao \net al. (2023) presented a deep learning model \nnamed PANDA (Pancreatic Cancer Detection \nwith Artificial Intelligence) that significantly \nimproves the detection and diagnosis of PDAC \nand other pancreatic lesions through non- \ncontrast CT scans.195 PANDA was trained on \na large dataset of patients from a single center \nand validated across multiple centers. It showed \nremarkable accuracy, outperforming radiologists \nin detecting lesions and identifying PDAC, with \nhigh sensitivity and specificity.195\nIt has been also shown that estimations from the \ngut microbiome data for PDAC, Kartal et al. (2022) \ninvestigated the potential of fecal microbiomes as \na non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for PDAC.196 \nUtilizing shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA \namplicon sequencing, fecal and salivary micro­\nbiome from PDAC patients, chronic pancreatitis \npatients, and controls were studied, and fecal meta­\ngenomic classifiers, especially those based on 27 \nmicrobial species, could accurately identify PDAC \nwith high specificity. Combining these classifiers \nwith the CA19–9 serum marker, the only FDA- \napproved PDAC diagnostic biomarker, signifi­\ncantly improved diagnostic accuracy. This research \nhighlights the feasibility of using fecal microbiota- \nbased screening for early detection of PDAC.196\nWhile machine learning offers promising tools \nfor the integrated analysis of various data types, \nresearchers face several challenges when working \nwith microbiome data:\n●Data Availability. The high cost of DNA ana­\nlysis, particularly for metagenomics, and the \nsporadic nature of disease occurrences often \nresult in microbiome datasets with lower sam­\nple sizes.197,198 To address this issue, strategies \nlike utilizing pretrained models or generating \nsynthetic data can help provide more \nexamples.\n●Model Performance. Accurate model devel­\nopment is crucial. For microbiome data, deci­\nsion-tree-based approaches such as random \nforest199 and gradient boosting200 are pre­\nferred.

Tools \nlike Docker204 facilitate managing software \ndependencies and documenting all workflow \nsteps enhances reproducibility.\nDespite these challenges, leveraging machine learn­\ning in microbiome research holds transformative \npotential for early cancer detection and treatment \nprediction, particularly in diseases like PDAC. As \nmethodologies improve and integration deepens, \nthese tools are increasingly important for develop­\ning personalized treatment strategies that are \ninformed by detailed, data-driven insights into \nindividual microbiome profiles.\n4.2. Low-Biomass microbiome analysis in cancer \ntissues\nThe advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) \nhas revolutionized our ability to analyze micro­\nbiomes, including those present in human cancer \ntissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded \n(FFPE) tissues. These low-biomass microbiome \nsamples provide valuable insights into the micro­\nbial environment of tumors. However, the analysis \nof such samples presents specific challenges due to \nthe inherently low concentration of micro­\nbial DNA.\nA significant issue in low-biomass microbiome \nanalyses is contamination, which can overshadow \nthe actual microbial signal from the samples. \nBacterial contaminants introduced during sample \ncollection, DNA extraction, and library prepara­\ntion can generate substantial background noise, \nmaking it difficult to discern the true microbial \nprofile within tissues.205 This issue is exacerbated \nin medical samples, where the lack of appropriate \ncontrols further complicates the analysis.206 To \naddress these challenges and enhance the accuracy \nof low-biomass microbiome analyses, methodolo­\ngical approaches have been proposed and imple­\nmented. These strategies aim to minimize \ncontamination and improve the detection of the \nactual microbial DNA present in the samples. \nSuch approaches might include rigorous control \nof the laboratory environment, the use of reagents \nand materials with minimal microbial DNA con­\ntamination, and the implementation of specific \nbioinformatic tools to distinguish between con­\ntaminant and sample-derived sequences.\nThe RIDE (Report, Include, Determine, \nExplore) criteria, proposed by Eisenhoffer et al. \n(2019), represent a comprehensive approach to \nmitigate bacterial contamination in low-biomass \nmicrobiome studies.207 These criteria have become \nparticularly important in ensuring the accuracy \nand reliability of microbiome studies, especially \nthose involving low-biomass samples. In addition \nto the RIDE criteria, Dohlman et al. (2021) sug­\ngested including negative and positive controls in \nstudies to differentiate between bacterial contami­\nnants and the biological samples of interest.208 \nThese controls are crucial in discerning true biolo­\ngical signals from contamination artifacts.\nTo aid in filtering bacterial contaminants from \nbiological samples, bioinformatics tools such as \nR Decontam209 and SourceTracker210 have been \ndeveloped. These programs are publicly available \nand provide researchers with sophisticated meth­\nods to identify and remove contaminant \nsequences. For instance, Poore et al. (2020) uti­\nlized DNA and RNA concentrations to identify \npotential bacterial contamination at the genus \nlevel. They then applied this information to \nremove these genera from negative blank \nreagents used as negative controls.211 Gihawi \net al. (2023) emphasized the importance of \nincluding genera only when there is strong com­\nputational and biological evidence for their pre­\nsence in the sample of interest.212 This careful \nconsideration is essential given the high likeli­\nhood of bacterial contamination in low-biomass \nsamples.

Sterile processing in sample \ncollection, DNA extraction, and library prepara­\ntion for sequencing remains vital to prevent con­\ntamination \nand \nensure \nthe \nintegrity \nof \nmicrobiome data.\nRecent advancements in microbiome research \nhave significantly enhanced our understanding of \nthe microbial diversity and composition within \nsolid tumors. Two notable studies exemplify the \napplication of sophisticated techniques and con­\ntrols to reliably profile intra-tumoral microbiomes, \nhighlighting the diversity across different cancer \ntypes and refining the identification and exclusion \nof potential contaminants. Nejman et al. (2020) \nconducted a comprehensive study on 1,526 intra- \ntumoral microbiomes across seven solid tumor \ntypes.213 Using a 16S rRNA multi-region approach \ncoupled with stringent negative controls, they \nimplemented several filtering steps to address bac­\nterial contamination. Their analysis revealed sub­\nstantial differences in diversity and composition \nwithin these tumor types. This study is significant \nbecause it underscores the complex and varied \nnature of the tumor microbiome, which could \nhave implications for understanding tumor biol­\nogy, treatment responses, and potential therapeutic \ntargets. Roelands et al.

(2014) and \nPoore et al. (2020).205,211 This list of potential con­\ntaminants was then used to eliminate these bacteria \nfrom the abundance matrix, thus refining the ana­\nlysis of the true microbiome present in the samples. \nBy excluding known contaminants, this method \nenhances the reliability of microbiome data, lead­\ning to more precise insights into the microbial \necology of tumors.\nThese studies represent significant strides in \nmicrobiome research within oncology, demon­\nstrating the importance of rigorous methodologies \nand controls in studying low biomass environ­\nments such as tumors. They highlight the diversity \nof the tumor microbiome across different cancers \nand the necessity of careful consideration in iden­\ntifying and excluding bacterial contaminants. By \nadhering to these practices, researchers can \ngenerate more accurate and reliable data, contri­\nbuting to the growing understanding of the micro­\nbiome’s role in health and disease.\n4.3. Experimental models to explore \nmicrobiome-host interactions in PDAC\nRecent advancements in PDAC research have \nincreasingly highlighted the importance of orga­\nnoid technology and microbiome interactions in \nunderstanding tumor biology and treatment resis­\ntance. Organoids, particularly patient-derived \norganoids (PDOs), have revolutionized cancer \nresearch by providing three-dimensional cultures \nthat closely mimic the in vivo tumor environment. \nThese models have been instrumental in studying \ncancer pathogenesis, drug resistance, and treat­\nment efficacy, offering a promising platform for \npersonalized medicine. Studies in gastric cancer \nand CRC have led the forefront in organoid \nresearch, as indicated by the works of.215–224 \nHowever, integrating microbiome research with \nPDOs in PDAC presents unique challenges and \nopportunities. The tumor microbiome is now \nrecognized as a significant factor in PDAC onco­\ngenesis, influencing tumor growth, immune mod­\nulation, and chemotherapy resistance. Studies have \nshown that co-culturing PDOs with some bacteria \ncan better replicate the TME, providing deeper \ninsights into the complex interactions between \ntumor cells and the microbiome.225–227\nA pivotal study by Chen et al. (2022) demon­\nstrated the role of type I collagen (Col1) homotri­\nmers in PDAC. The researchers found that \npancreatic cancer cells produce a unique Col1 \nhomotrimer (α1/α1/α1), which is absent in normal \ncells. This aberrant collagen variant promotes \ntumor growth and resistance to chemotherapy by \nengaging with the α3β1 integrin on cancer cells, \nsubsequently influencing the tumor microbiome \nand immune landscape. Using PDOs, the study \nrevealed that the presence of Col1 homotrimers \nenhances tumor cell proliferation and resistance \nto chemotherapeutic agents like gemcitabine. \nAdditionally, gnotobiotic mouse models demon­\nstrated that deletion of Col1 homotrimers resulted \nin a reprogrammed tumor microbiome, character­\nized by reduced Bacteroidales and increased \nCampylobacterales, which is associated with \n20\nJ. DE CASTILHOS ET AL."}, {"page_number": 22, "text": "improved immune infiltration and response to \nanti-PD-1 immunotherapy.228 These findings \nunderscore the importance of the tumor microen­\nvironment, including the microbiome, in modulat­\ning cancer progression and treatment efficacy. By \nleveraging \nPDOs \nand \ngnotobiotic \nmodels, \nresearchers can further dissect the molecular and \nmicrobial interactions that drive PDAC, offering \npotential avenues for targeted therapies that incor­\nporate microbiome modulation.\nDespite several advancements, significant chal­\nlenges remain. One primary issue is the lack of \nstandardized methods for co-culturing PDOs with \nbacteria, which can affect the reproducibility and \nreliability of results. The transcriptional landscape \nof PDOs can be heavily influenced by culture con­\nditions, potentially altering their response to phar­\nmacological interventions. Additionally, the \ncomplexity of the TME in PDAC, characterized \nby a dense stroma and low cellularity, makes it \ndifficult to fully recapitulate it in vitro.\nThe use of gnotobiotic mouse models also has \nsignificantly contributed to our understanding \nof the microbiome’s role in oncogenesis and \ncancer therapy. These models, characterized by \ntheir germ-free status or a defined microbiota, \nprovide a controlled environment for studying \nthe impact of microorganisms on various \naspects of cancer, including development, pro­\ngression, \nand \nresponse \nto \ntreatment. \nGnotobiotic mice allow researchers to introduce \nspecific bacteria or bacterial consortia and \nobserve their direct effects on tumor growth, \nimmune modulation, and treatment efficacy. \nThis approach has been utilized in several stu­\ndies, including those by.190,229–232 These studies \nhave shed light on how particular microbial \ncommunities or metabolites can influence can­\ncer dynamics. Despite their utility, the applica­\ntion of gnotobiotic mouse models in PDAC \nresearch is still relatively nascent. Nonetheless, \nthese models hold great promise for advancing \nour understanding of PDAC, particularly in the \ncontext of microbial metabolites. For instance, \nTintelnot et al. (2023) explored the impact of \nthese metabolites on PDAC pathogenesis, offer­\ning valuable insights into the complex relation­\nship between the microbiome and cancer.101 By \nunderstanding the specific interactions between \nthe microbiome and PDAC, researchers can \ndevelop more personalized and effective cancer \ncare strategies.\nFinally, phage display technology, which \ninvolves using bacteriophages to discover pep­\ntides and antibodies with specific binding affi­\nnities, has been extensively utilized in cancer \nresearch and the exploration of bacteriophages \nas a therapeutic strategy for targeting intratu­\nmoral bacteria presents an innovative approach \nin cancer treatment, particularly in the context of \nPDAC. Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that \nselectively infect and destroy specific bacterial \nspecies. Their ability to precisely target certain \nbacterial populations makes them a promising \ntool for modulating the microbiome in a cancer- \nspecific context. Recent research, including stu­\ndies by Zheng et al. (2020), Li et al. (2023), and \nDong et al. (2023), is investigating the potential of \nbacteriophages in both preclinical and clinical \nsettings.2,233,234 The use of bacteriophages offers \na targeted method to alter the gut microbiome, \nwith therapeutic effects that can be confined to \nspecific organs or tumor sites. PDAC poses \nunique challenges for effective drug delivery due \nto the tumor’s dense stroma and complex micro­\nenvironment. However, initial studies, such as \nthose by Asar et al. (2020) and Kabwe et al. \n(2022), suggest that bacteriophages can success­\nfully infiltrate pancreatic tumors.235,236 This cap­\nability could significantly enhance the delivery \nand efficacy of therapeutic agents in PDAC. \nSome products derived from this technology \nhave even received FDA approval for cancer ther­\napy, as highlighted by Passariello et al. (2020).237 \nDespite its success in other cancer types, the \napplication of phage display and bacteriophage \ntherapy in PDAC is still in its early stages.\n5. Conclusions\nThe gut microbiome’s influence on chemotherapy \nefficacy, particularly in PDAC, hinges on several \nmechanisms, notably drug metabolism and \nimmune modulation. Gut bacteria produce \nenzymes, which can activate or deactivate che­\nmotherapy drugs, increasing efficacy, but also toxi­\ncity. Additionally, gut microbes can alter the \nbioavailability of chemotherapeutic drugs by \nGUT MICROBES\n21"}, {"page_number": 23, "text": "modifying their absorption and distribution, \npotentially enhancing or diminishing drug efficacy. \nThe gut microbiome also modulates the immune \nsystem, crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of \nchemotherapy. Certain gut bacteria can induce \ncytokine production, or T cell differentiation bol­\nstering antitumor immune responses and thereby \nimproving chemotherapy efficacy. Moreover, gut \nmicrobes preserve gut barrier integrity, regulate \na host’s immune milieu and affects the tumor \nmicroenvironment which all impacts on che­\nmotherapy tolerability, toxicity and efficacy. In \nthe exploration of the microbiome’s influence on \nchemotherapy efficacy in PDAC, we’ve seen how \nadvances in microbiome-based therapies, driven by \nsynthetic biology and enhanced understanding of \nmicrobe-host interactions, are revolutionizing \nPDAC treatments.\nDespite these promising developments, some \nfindings remain inconclusive due to differences in \nstudy design, patient populations, and microbiome \nanalysis methods. Although research in mouse \nmodels has provided insights into the micro­\nbiome’s effects on tumor development and \nimmune system interactions, the variability in \nmicrobiome composition among individuals and \nspecies differences present challenges in translating \nthese findings to humans. Also, the composition of \nthe gut microbiome varies significantly between \nindividuals, influenced by factors such as diet, \ngenetics, and environment. This variability can \nlead to different interactions with chemotherapy \ndrugs, making it challenging to generalize findings \nacross diverse populations. These inconsistencies \nhighlight the multifactorial nature of chemother­\napy efficacy, influenced by genetics, tumor biology, \nand patient health status, making it difficult to \nisolate the impact of the gut microbiome. Another \nconcern is the use of meticulous sampling, careful \nprocessing and precise analysis of microbial \nsequencing and metabolomic datasets. The poten­\ntial of microbiome-targeted interventions in PDAC \nis promising, highlighting the need for further \nresearch to fully exploit the microbiome’s diagnos­\ntic and therapeutic capabilities. This evolving field \noffers new prospects for more personalized and \neffective chemotherapy strategies in PDAC treat­\nment, representing a significant step forward in \nmedical oncology.\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nFunding\nThis work was supported by funding of the German Research \nFoundation (DFG) (STE 2964/6-1) and German Cancer Aid \n(70114731) to C.S.T.\nReferences\n1.

Introduction\nPancreatic cancer, a malignancy originating in the pancreas, is a critical health concern\nand a challenging disease due to its aggressive nature and often asymptomatic early\nCancers 2024, 16, 2329. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16132329\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers"}, {"page_number": 2, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n2 of 21\nstages [1]. The pancreas, located in the upper abdomen, plays a crucial role in digestion\nand hormone regulation. However, people often detect the disease only in advanced stages,\npartly due to its lack of early and specific symptoms [2]. There are two primary types\nof pancreatic cancer: exocrine and neuroendocrine. Exocrine pancreatic cancer, which\naccounts for over 90% of cases, stems from the exocrine cells that form the pancreas’s\nglands and ducts, with adenocarcinoma being the most prevalent subtype, though others\nlike squamous cell and colloid carcinomas exist. On the other hand, neuroendocrine\npancreatic cancer originates from the endocrine cells producing hormones like insulin\nand glucagon [3,4]. Neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer is a rarer subtype of pancreatic\ncancer and, unfortunately, it remains challenging for providers to treat both the tumor\ngrowth as well as correlated symptoms, with surgery still persisting as the main form of\ntreatment for this subtype [5]. For the purpose of this review, however, we will be focusing\non the exocrine subtype of pancreatic cancer. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include severe\nabdominal pain, weight loss, jaundice, dark urine, clay stools, itching, appetite loss, blood\nclots, fatigue, and new-onset diabetes. Diagnosis typically involves imaging tests and a\nbiopsy [6]. Despite medical advancements, pancreatic cancer’s survival rates remain low,\nnecessitating treatment modalities like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination,\nhighlighting the ongoing challenge this disease poses to healthcare and the urgent need for\nfurther research in the field.\n1.1. Pancreatic Cancer Epidemiology\nEpidemiologically, pancreatic cancer incidence has steadily increased over the years. It\nranks as the twelfth most prevalent cancer among males, the eleventh most prevalent cancer\namong females, and is currently the seventh most significant contributor to cancer-related\nmortality globally [7]. The American Cancer Society (ACS) predicts that 66,440 individuals\nin the US will receive a pancreatic cancer diagnosis in 2024. Of these, 34,530 will be men,\nand 31,910 will be women. Tragically, the disease will claim the lives of approximately\n51,750 people, including 27,270 men and 24,480 women. Researchers estimated that the\naverage lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer is one in 56 men and one in 60 women.\nThe incidence and mortality rates are nearly identical, highlighting the aggressive nature\nof this disease and the urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies [8]. By 2040,\nprojections indicate that pancreatic cancer will become the second most common cause of\ncancer-related mortality in the United States [9]. This highlights the urgent need to enhance\nour understanding and treatment of this fatal disease. These data highlight the pressing\nnecessity for more awareness, research, and innovative approaches to improve pancreatic\ncancer care.\n1.2. Current Standards of Care\nThe current standards of care for pancreatic cancer include surgery, chemotherapy,\nand radiation therapy. However, these conventional treatments often offer limited benefits,\nparticularly in the advanced stages of the disease. Among the established treatment\nregimens, FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel have emerged as cornerstones\nin the therapeutic armamentarium. FOLFIRINOX is a combination chemotherapy regimen\nthat includes fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. It has been shown to work\nin certain patient groups. Similarly, gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel has emerged as a viable\ntreatment option for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [10]. These regimens, while\noffering incremental improvements in patient outcomes, fail to achieve meaningful long-\nterm survival benefits. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches\nthat address the underlying biology of the disease and offer improved outcomes for patients.\nIn a pivotal phase 3 trial, NAPOLI 3 compared NALIRIFOX with nab-paclitaxel and\ngemcitabine as initial therapies for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC).\nThe study, conducted globally across 187 sites, demonstrated a significant improvement\nin median overall survival with NALIRIFOX (11.1 months) compared to nab-paclitaxel-\ngemcitabine (9.2 months). Both regimens exhibited manageable safety profiles, with similar"}, {"page_number": 3, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n3 of 21\nrates of grade 3 or higher adverse events and treatment-related deaths. These results\nposition NALIRIFOX as a potential standard of care for first-line treatment of mPDAC [11].\nAmong these challenges, precision medicine has emerged as promising hope, poten-\ntially offering a new approach to pancreatic cancer management [12]. By understanding\nthe intricate molecular landscape of the disease, precision medicine holds promise for\npersonalized interventions tailored to the unique genetic makeup of individual patients.\nWe therefore aim and hope to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular classification of\npancreatic cancer and apply next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify unique genetic\nalterations for therapy, which could significantly benefit a subset of patients. Exploring\nDNA damage response (DDR) processes and their mutations in pancreatic cancer is a\nvibrant field of study. The development of pancreatic cancer is significantly associated\nwith mutations in key DDR genes, such as BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 [13]. Additionally, recent\nprogress has shown new possible approaches to treat pancreatic cancer, such as targeting\nMDM2 amplification, Claudin 18.2, and MTAP deletion [14–16].

While pancreatic cancer presents a plethora of challenges owing to its aggressive\nnature and limited treatment options, the emergence of biomarker-driven therapies offers a\nsparkle of hope.\n2. Present and Future of Precision Medicine in Pancreatic Cancer\nIn the context of pancreatic cancer management, precision medicine emerges as a\npromising assay, paving the way to personalized interventions tailored to the genetic\nmakeup of individual patients [26,27]. At its core, precision medicine entails molecular\ntesting with a therapeutic purpose, aiming to identify actionable biomarkers that present\na significant predictive value in guiding treatment decisions. Precision medicine in the\ncontext of pancreatic cancer involves tailoring medical treatments based on an individual’s\nunique biology. This approach relies on biomarker testing of tumor tissue, which reveals\nthe tumor’s specific genes and proteins. By understanding these molecular characteristics,\ndoctors can therefore customize treatment approaches to target the tumor more effec-\ntively. Genetic testing is another crucial component of precision medicine [28]. It identifies\ninherited mutations that can impact how the tumor responds to treatment. Additionally, re-\nsearchers have explored the use of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) for precision medicine\nin pancreatic cancer [26]. Researchers create PDOs from tissues obtained during surgical\nresection or biopsies, which enable ex vivo chemotherapeutic screening (pharmacotyp-\ning) and predict clinical therapeutic responses. Molecular profiling is also key, involving\nthe analysis of genetic and molecular characteristics to identify effective treatment regi-\nmens [29]. This approach considers both genome-based medicine and individualized drug\nscreening, aiming to improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.\n2.1. Molecular Classification and Precision Medicine\nMolecular classification, or molecular subtyping, is not the same as precision medicine.\nPrecision medicine extends beyond traditional molecular classification, which involves\nlarge-scale molecular characterization, often from large consortia of patient samples us-\ning gene sequencing and transcriptomics. Molecular classification involves categorizing\ndiseases, such as cancer, based on specific molecular or genetic features like alterations in\nDNA, RNA, proteins, or other cellular components [30,31]. Its purpose is to identify distinct\nsubtypes within a disease, allowing for more precise diagnosis and treatment tailored to\nspecific patient groups. In pancreatic cancer, molecular classification helps identify different\ntumor subtypes based on genetic mutations, gene expression patterns, or protein markers,\nwhich can influence disease progression and treatment options.\nPrecision medicine, on the other hand, aims to provide individualized treatment\nbased on a patient’s unique characteristics, including genetics, environment, lifestyle, and\ndisease profile [32,33]. It goes beyond a one-size-fits-all approach by considering variability\namong patients and tailoring interventions accordingly. Precision medicine in pancreatic\ncancer involves biomarker testing to identify specific genetic alterations (e.g., mutations\nin BRCA1/2, PALB2) that guide treatment decisions, targeted therapies that specifically\ntarget molecular abnormalities (e.g., PARP inhibitors for patients with BRCA mutations),\nand leveraging immunotherapies based on individual immune profiles [34,35].\nThe key differences between molecular classification and precision medicine lie in their\nscope, clinical application, and level of personalization. Molecular classification focuses\non understanding disease subtypes based on molecular features, informing diagnosis\nand prognosis. Precision medicine, on the other hand, encompasses a broader approach,\nconsidering individual patient characteristics for tailored treatment decisions aimed at"}, {"page_number": 6, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n6 of 21\nimproving outcomes. In summary, both concepts work together to optimize treatment\nstrategies and improve outcomes in pancreatic cancer by understanding the disease’s\ndiverse nature and translating this knowledge into individualized patient care.\n2.2. Next-Generation Sequencing Efforts in Pancreatic Cancer\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding\nof pancreatic cancer and guiding personalized treatment strategies [36]. NGS efforts identify\nthese biomarkers by enabling a more comprehensive analysis of tumor genomes, revealing\na diverse array of potential therapeutic targets. NGS efforts in pancreatic cancer have\nconsistently revealed that at least 25% of pancreatic cancers harbor potentially actionable\nmolecular biomarkers [37]. The majority of these biomarkers fall into the DNA damage\nresponse and repair (DDR) category or DDR mutations. Some patients, in small but\nrepeatable groups, also show changes in microsatellite instability (MSI), different receptor\ntyrosine kinases, and different molecular signaling pathways [38–41]. These are potentially\ntargetable, especially as our drugs to target those pathways are increasing in number.\nPancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy with technical challenges for genomic\nresearch. Traditional methods fall short due to the complexity of the disease. NGS allows\ncomprehensive analysis of the entire genome, revealing somatic alterations unique to each\ntumor. By analyzing miRNA and specific proteins, oncologists can pinpoint therapeutic\ntargets specific to pancreatic cancer [42]. NGS helps identify actionable alterations that\nguide treatment decisions. By tailoring therapies based on individual genomic profiles,\nNGS enables personalized approaches. This customization improves patient outcomes\nand offers hope for better survival rates. Combining NGS with machine learning allows\ndeeper insights into tumor exomes [43]. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast genomic\ndata, predict treatment responses, and guide precision medicine strategies. In summary,\nNGS empowers clinicians to unravel the genomic complexity of pancreatic cancer, identify\npotential therapeutic targets, and pave the way for personalized treatment options.\n2.3. Remarkaable Benefit\nDisproportionate benefit in pancreatic cancer refers to the significant advantages\na specific intervention or treatment can provide for a particular subgroup of patients\ncompared to others [44]. Cases, where appropriate therapy targets molecular abnormalities,\nexemplify this benefit, leading to treatment responses that significantly surpass the typical\noutcomes of standard cancer care. For instance, approximately one percent or slightly\nless of pancreatic cancers are MSI-high or have a mismatch repair deficiency [45]. When\nimmunotherapy targets these tumors appropriately, patients often experience substantial\nbenefits.\nNeoadjuvant treatment has emerged as a crucial strategy in the management of pancre-\natic cancer, particularly for patients with locally advanced disease or borderline resectable\ntumors. This approach involves administering chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy before\nsurgical resection. The rationale behind neoadjuvant therapy includes downsizing the\ntumor, potentially increasing the likelihood of achieving complete surgical resection (R0\nresection), and addressing micrometastases early in the treatment course.\nIn pancreatic cancer management, disproportionate benefit plays a crucial role in\nseveral aspects:\n1.\nImproved Survival with Surgery: Patients with pancreatic cancer who are eligible\nfor surgery to remove the tumor can expect a significantly longer survival. Experts\nconsider surgical resection as potentially curative, particularly when the tumor re-\nmains localized and has not spread beyond the pancreas [46]. According to recent\nstudies, the median survival for patients undergoing successful surgical resection can\nbe extended to approximately 20–23 months compared to a median of 6–11 months\nwith non-surgical management. Moreover, advancements in surgical techniques\nand perioperative care have further improved outcomes, reducing postoperative\ncomplications and enhancing recovery rates [47]."}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n7 of 21\n2.\nTailoring Therapies: While the majority of pancreatic cancer patients do not have\ngermline mutations, using all available tools, including genetic testing, can help\nselect therapies. Personalized treatment may not achieve a cure but can improve\nquality of life and extend survival [48,49]. For example, patients with BRCA muta-\ntions may benefit from PARP inhibitors, which have shown promise in prolonging\nprogression-free survival. Additionally, tailored chemotherapeutic regimens based\non genetic profiling can lead to better management outcomes. The implementation\nof molecular profiling in routine clinical practice allows for more precise targeting of\ntherapies, potentially leading to better responses and fewer side effects compared to\nconventional treatments. The implementation of molecular profiling in routine clinical\npractice allows for more precise targeting of therapies, potentially leading to better\nresponses and fewer side effects compared to conventional treatments. Precision\nmedicine approaches, guided by biomarker or genetic testing, have demonstrated\nsignificant benefits in patient outcomes. Specifically, therapies matched to biomarkers\nor genetic profiles have been associated with extended survival rates (Pancreatic\nCancer Action Network [PanCAN], 2024). PanCAN advocates for the adoption of\ngenetic testing for inherited mutations at the time of diagnosis and recommends\nbiomarker testing of tumor tissue for all patients, unless medically contraindicated.\nThey provide comprehensive resources, including the Know Your Tumor® precision\nmedicine service, to facilitate informed treatment decisions and enhance patient care.\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) is now widely utilized to detect diagnostic, prog-\nnostic, and predictive mutations across various cancers, contributing significantly to\nenhanced treatment efficacy [45,50,51]. In pancreatic cancer (PC), genomic profiling\ndata have demonstrated potential benefits in guiding treatment decisions and im-\nproving patient survival [52,53]. Precision medicine, which tailors therapies based on\nmolecular profiling of gene expressions and mutations, is anticipated to play a crucial\nrole, especially in cases of unresectable pancreatic cancer. These mutations often\ninvolve genes such as KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4, among others, which\nare known to play critical roles in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and progression.\nThe identification of these mutations through NGS holds promise for personalized\ntreatment approaches, including targeted therapies and enrollment in clinical trials\naimed at exploiting specific molecular vulnerabilities in pancreatic cancer cells. De-\nspite challenges such as tumor heterogeneity and the complex genomic landscape of\npancreatic cancer, NGS continues to emerge as a valuable tool in oncology.\n3.\nChallenges: Regrettably, only approximately 10% of patients with pancreatic cancer\nreceive an early diagnosis, thereby qualifying them for potentially curative surgical\nresection [50]. Most cases receive a diagnosis at a more advanced stage, which restricts\nthe available treatment options. This highlights the need for improved early detection\nmethods and public awareness to increase the rate of early diagnosis and intervention.\nFurthermore, the development of more effective systemic therapies for advanced-\nstage pancreatic cancer remains a critical area of ongoing research. Recent efforts in\nbiomarker discovery and the utilization of liquid biopsies are promising steps toward\nearlier detection and better monitoring of treatment response.\n2.4. Future Perspectives in Precision Medicine\nIdentifying and understanding the several benefits and potential of precision medicine\nin pancreatic cancer allows clinicians to tailor treatments, improve outcomes, and enhance\nthe quality of life for patients with this challenging disease. By recognizing which sub-\ngroups of patients are likely to benefit the most from specific interventions, clinicians can\nmake more informed decisions, optimizing the use of available therapies and predicting\ntherapy response. This targeted approach therefore not only improves survival rates but\nalso minimizes unnecessary side effects, making treatment more tolerable for patients [34].\nFurthermore, the integration of advanced diagnostic tools and personalized medicine\nenables a more precise approach to cancer care. By taking advantage of genetic testing"}, {"page_number": 8, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n8 of 21\nand molecular profiling, healthcare providers can identify actionable mutations and tailor\ntherapies accordingly, leading to better management of the disease. This personalized\napproach is particularly crucial in pancreatic cancer, where the heterogeneity of the tumor\noften requires individualized treatment plans. The potential for disproportionate benefits\nalso underscores the importance of continued research and innovation in pancreatic cancer\ntreatment. As new therapies and diagnostic techniques are developed, the ability to identify\npatients who will benefit the most from these advancements will be essential. This will\nnot only improve clinical outcomes but also contribute to a more efficient allocation of\nhealthcare resources, ensuring that the most effective treatments are available to those who\nneed them the most [34].\nUltimately, the goal is to move towards a more precise, patient-centered model of care\nthat not only extends survival but also enhances the overall quality of life for patients with\npancreatic cancer. This involves a multidisciplinary approach, combining the expertise\nof oncologists, surgeons, geneticists, and other healthcare professionals to provide com-\nprehensive and effective care. As we continue to understand the unique benefits certain\ntreatments can provide to specific patient populations, we can move one step closer to\nalways more successful and personalized cancer therapies.\n3. Advancing Pancreatic Cancer Treatment: The Power of Targeted Therapies and\nGenetic Insights\nIdentifying and understanding the plethora of benefits of targeted therapy in pan-\ncreatic cancer allows clinicians to tailor treatments, improve outcomes, and enhance the\nquality of life for patients with this challenging disease. By leveraging targeted therapies\nand advanced diagnostic tools, healthcare providers can indeed significantly impact patient\nprognosis, especially when specific genetic abnormalities are present. One critical area of\nfocus in pancreatic cancer treatment is the role of genetic mutations in the DNA Damage\nResponse (DDR) pathway.\nDNA Damage Response (DDR) is an integral process in DNA replication that allows\nthe body to identify damage done to the DNA and repair it. However, when the DDR\nprocess is altered or abnormal, the mutation can allow for damaged DNA to replicate\nwithout correction. From an oncological perspective, patients with a DDR abnormality\nare at a higher risk of developing cancer. Looking specifically at pancreatic cancer, it is\nfound that approximately 17–25% of patients present mutations of a DDR gene [25]. These\nare specific to the homologous recombination pathway of the DDR gene (HR-DDR) [1].\nHR-DDR mutations most notably occur in the BRCA-1, BRCA-2, ATM, PALB2, ATRX, and\nRAD51 genes [25].\nBRCA-1 (Breast Cancer 1 Gene) and BRCA-2 (Breast Cancer 2 Gene) specifically\naccount for 5–7% of mutations, yet up to 40% of patients with BRCA mutations do not\nhave a family history of cancer [25]. This highlights the importance of germline testing\nto detect these mutations, irrespective of family history. These genes play crucial roles in\nDNA repair and homologous recombination, serving to suppress tumors by preventing\nthe replication of damaged DNA [51]. Unfortunately, mutations in these genes can lead\nto a loss of tumor suppression function, allowing tumors to develop [51]. While BRCA\nmutations are traditionally associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, recent\nstudies have identified these mutations also in the context of pancreatic cancer [25,52].\nIn addition to BRCA mutations, other genes involved in the DDR pathway, such as\nATM, PALB2, ATRX, and RAD51, are also implicated in pancreatic cancer susceptibility [25].\nThese genes play diverse roles in DNA repair processes, and mutations in any of them\ncan contribute to pancreatic tumorigenesis. Understanding the specific mutations present\nin individual patients is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and improving outcomes.\nHowever, detecting these mutations solely based on family history could be a limitation\nand may lead to overlooking a significant portion of patients who could also benefit\nfrom targeted therapies. Furthermore, beyond genetic testing, advancements in treatment\nmodalities have led to the development of targeted therapies tailored to specific genetic"}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n9 of 21\nmutations. One such approach is platinum-based chemotherapy, which has shown efficacy\nin patients with DDR mutations [25,51]. This treatment works by eradicating tumor\ncells and preventing their further replication. However, platinum-based chemotherapy\nis associated with significant side effects, underscoring the need for alternative treatment\noptions [52].\nPoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARP inhibitors) represent a promising\nclass of targeted cancer drugs that inhibit the enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP),\nwhich is involved in DNA replication and repair [53]. Recent studies have demonstrated\nimproved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with BRCA mutations treated with\nPARP inhibitors [25,52]. However, the efficacy of PARP inhibitors may vary depending\non the specific genetic alterations present in the tumor. Additionally, ongoing research is\nexploring combination therapies involving PARP inhibitors to enhance treatment outcomes\nand overcome potential resistance mechanisms. Despite their efficacy, PARP inhibitors\nare not without side effects. Common adverse reactions include fatigue, nausea, and\nanemia; however, these effects are generally manageable and do not significantly impact\nthe patient’s health-related quality of life [52]. Several PARP inhibition drugs have either\nundergone clinical trials or received approval for tumor management. As of 2023, the\nFederal Drug Administration (FDA) has sanctioned four PARP-inhibitor drugs for clini-\ncal use: olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib [54], primarily for monotherapy\nPARP-inhibition therapy treatment. Current clinical studies are exploring combination\ntherapies involving PARP inhibitors to enhance patient outcomes and overcome potential\nresistance mechanisms [55]. These combination strategies include androgen deprivation,\nimmunotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiation therapy [55]. The aim of these\ntrials is to reduce the PARP inhibition resistance observed in some patients. While further\nresearch is required for conclusive evidence, preliminary results from these combination\ntherapies are already promising, indicating potential avenues to overcome PARP-inhibition\nresistance. Currently, platinum chemotherapy stands as the primary treatment modality for\npatients with germline mutations in pancreatic cancer. However, this approach comes with\nnotable drawbacks, including its association with severe and sometimes debilitating side\neffects. Recognizing the limitations of platinum chemotherapy, the integration of PARP\ninhibition therapy into treatment protocols emerges as an equally crucial consideration.\nWhile the concurrent use of PARP inhibitors alongside platinum chemotherapy holds\npromise, recent studies have shed light on potential challenges. One study revealed the\npresence of a potential cross-resistance phenomenon when these treatments are admin-\nistered sequentially. Despite this, a substantial proportion—over 40%—of patients still\nexhibited responsiveness to sequential treatment. These findings underscore the complex-\nity of treatment interactions and emphasize the need for further research to understand\noptimal treatment sequencing strategies [56].\nMoreover, the efficacy of PARP inhibition therapy is not uniformly positive across\nall patient subgroups. Variability in treatment response is often attributed to the diverse\nspectrum of DNA alterations present in pancreatic cancer. Consequently, identifying\nwhich patients would derive the most benefit from PARP inhibition therapy poses a\nsignificant clinical challenge. While PARP inhibition holds potential for certain patient\nsubsets, the lack of information regarding its efficacy in specific pancreatic cancer subtypes\nunderscores the imperative for further research. Clarifying the molecular underpinnings\nof treatment response will enhance the clinical reliability of PARP inhibition therapy and\ninform personalized treatment approaches tailored to individual patient profiles [57].\nTherefore, while the integration of PARP inhibition therapy alongside platinum\nchemotherapy represents a promising weapon in pancreatic cancer treatment, challenges\nsuch as potential cross-resistance and variability in treatment response necessitate ongoing\nresearch efforts. Addressing these complexities will help to refine treatment strategies, opti-\nmize patient outcomes, and lead to more personalized and effective therapeutic approaches\nin the management of pancreatic cancer."}, {"page_number": 10, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n10 of 21\n4. Emerging Therapeutic Targets in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: MDM2, CLAUDIN\n18.2, and MTAP Deletion\nIn the field of oncology’s ever-expanding horizon, there is a plethora of novel emerging\ntargets, particularly in the context of metastatic pancreatic cancer survival. MDM2 ampli-\nfication plays a crucial role in disease progression by disrupting the regulatory balance\nbetween MDM2 and the tumor suppressor p53. This disruption promotes uncontrolled\ntumor growth and metastasis, contributing to the aggressive nature of the disease [15].\nWhile MDM2 amplification is relatively rare in pancreatic cancer compared to other malig-\nnancies, its significance as a driver of disease aggressiveness highlights its potential as a\ntherapeutic target [58]. Despite its low prevalence rates, MDM2 amplification presents a\nunique vulnerability for therapeutic aims, offering a promising strategy for combating this\nunfortunately nowadays deadly disease.\nIn recent years, early clinical trials investigating MDM2 inhibitors have reported\nencouraging results in pancreatic cancer patients [59]. These inhibitors aim to restore\np53-mediated tumor suppression and inhibit cancer cell proliferation, offering hope for\npatients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. While the outcomes of these trials are still\nevolving, initial findings showed tangible responses in select patient cohorts, highlighting\nthe potential efficacy of MDM2-targeted therapies in improving clinical outcomes. Particu-\nlarly, in de-differentiated liposarcomas, which share similarities with the aggressiveness of\npancreatic cancer, MDM2 inhibitors have shown efficacy, hinting at their potential appli-\ncability in advancing also the treatment landscape for pancreatic malignancies [60]. One\nspecific clinical trial, the Glow Trial, found that Zolbetuximab plus CAPOX significantly\nimproved progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS] in patients that were di-\nagnosed with claudin-18 isoform 2 [CLDN 18.2]-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced\nunresectable or mG/GEJ adenocarcinoma [61]. It was found that adding Zolbetuximab\nto chemotherapy saw an approximately 31% reduction in disease progression and an ap-\nproximately 25% reduction in disease-related death [61]. This study highlights the use of\ntumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and their indispensable use when it comes to treating\ngastrointestinal cancers [61].\nAs research progresses, further study of the mechanisms and prevalence of MDM2\namplification in pancreatic cancer, and ongoing clinical trials will provide valuable insights\ninto optimizing the efficacy and safety of MDM2-targeted therapies [62]. Overall, MDM2\namplification represents a promising therapeutic target in the context of metastatic pancre-\natic cancer management [63]. By offering a novel approach to disrupt oncogenic signaling\nand restore tumor suppressor function, targeting MDM2 amplification appears to have\nthe potential to improve outcomes for affected patients. Continued research and clinical\nexploration will be essential to fully realize the therapeutic potential of MDM2 inhibitors\nand to integrate them into the standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer.\nTargeting CLAUDIN 18.2 has appeared as a promising therapeutic strategy, particu-\nlarly in metastatic pancreatic cancer, owing to its pronounced expression in these tissue\ntumors. This tight junction protein therefore offers a tangible avenue for targeted interven-\ntions. The integration of CLAUDIN 18.2-targeted therapies, such as zolbetuximab, into\nstandard chemotherapy regimens, has shown promising results in clinical trials. Notably,\nthese trials have revealed improved progression-free and overall survival in CLAUDIN\n18.2-overexpressed gastric cancers. High expression of CLAUDIN 18.2 in pancreatic cancer\nis crucial, as it is associated with initiation, progression, metastasis, and prognosis, making\nit a potential therapeutic target [64]. Clinical trials evaluating CLAUDIN 18.2-targeted\ntherapies, including those for pancreatic and gastric cancers, are currently ongoing, though\nofficial results are pending. This research aims to understand efficacy data and poten-\ntial side effects, adding a significant piece of the puzzle to the therapeutic landscape for\nmetastatic pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, some additional studies have also been impor-\ntant to better characterize the function of this promising molecule. Zhou et al. demonstrated\nthat Claudin 18.2 can inversely regulate the activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP), thereby\npromoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [65]. Additionally, Claudin 18.1 has been"}, {"page_number": 11, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n11 of 21\nshown to inhibit Yes-associated protein/tafazzin (Yap/Taz) and insulin-like growth factor 1\nreceptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathways, ultimately resulting in AKT inhibition [66,67]. These\nfindings therefore emphasize the pivotal role of Claudins as important signaling centers\ninvolved in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [68].\nRecently, other potential candidate targets have also emerged, further enhancing inter-\nest and hope in the field. MTAP deletion, prevalent in 20% to 30% of pancreatic cancer cases,\nis a significant anomaly intricately linked to the disease’s progression. Previous research\nhas unveiled the grim prognosis associated with MTAP deficiency in pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC). Expanding on this understanding, bioinformatics analysis of The\nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data has described a distinct signature of heightened glycol-\nysis in PDACs lacking MTAP. The currently enigmatic role of MTAP deletion appears to\nhave promising and profound therapeutic implications for metastatic pancreatic cancer [69].\nWithin this complex pathway, loss of the MTAP enzyme compromises cellular vulnerability,\nrendering cancer cells susceptible to targeted interventions. Through inhibition of MAT2A\nor PRMT5, exploiting the synthetic lethality cascade, novel therapeutic modalities have\nemerged, holding promise for cancers presenting MTAP deletion, including metastatic\npancreatic malignancies. Clinical trials investigating PRMT5 and MAT2A inhibitors have\ndemonstrated encouraging outcomes, highlighting the potential of synthetic lethality-based\nstrategies in reshaping the treatment algorithm [70]. These findings therefore offer signifi-\ncant hope to patients, suggesting a promising shift towards more effective and targeted\ntherapeutic modalities.\nThe convergence of innovative targets and precision medicine opens a new era in\nthe management of metastatic pancreatic cancer. By moving beyond the one-size-fits-all\napproach, personalized therapies tailored to individual molecular profiles offer the poten-\ntial to significantly extend survival and improve patient outcomes [71]. Dr. Pishvaian’s\nKeynote emphasizes the need to embrace both innovation and precision to be able to\naim for improved metastatic pancreatic cancer survival. As emerging targets like MDM2\namplification, CLAUDIN 18.2-targeted therapies, and MTAP deletion become integrated\ninto clinical practice, personalized medicine is set to revolutionize the management of\nthis currently lethal disease. This not only brings hope to patients but also challenges the\noncology community to pursue further research in the field. Through genomic profiling\nand targeted interventions, the promise of prolonged survival and improved quality of life\nis becoming a tangible reality for patients.\nThe oncology community eagerly stands at the threshold of a new era, where precision\nand innovation drive the fight against cancer, with the potential of success also in the fight\nagainst the most advanced stages of this lethal disease.\n5. Ongoing Advancements in Pancreatic Cancer Management through Biomarker-Based\nClinical Trials and Precision Medicine\nBiomarker-based clinical trials and therapeutic strategies therefore represent a ground-\nbreaking advancement in the management of pancreatic cancer, aiming to optimize treat-\nment outcomes through personalized approaches. These innovative trials employ biomark-\ners to identify patient subpopulations most likely to benefit from specific therapeutic\ninterventions, including targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and combination regimens.\nBy integrating molecular profiling into clinical trial design, basket trials, umbrella trials,\nand adaptive trial designs enables the customization of treatment regimens tailored to\nindividual patients’ molecular profiles [72,73].\nCurrently, several clinical trials are underway to explore the efficacy of biomarker-\ndriven therapies in the context of pancreatic cancer.\nFor instance, the NCI-MATCH (Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice) trial is a na-\ntionwide precision medicine cancer treatment clinical trial that assigns patients to targeted\ntherapy based on the specific mutations identified in their tumors rather than their cancer\ntype [74]. Another notable example is the TAPUR (Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization\nRegistry) study, which evaluates the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved targeted therapies"}, {"page_number": 12, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n12 of 21\nin patients with advanced cancer harboring specific genetic alterations [75]. In addition,\nthe COMPASS (Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Advanced Pancreatic Ductal\nAdenocarcinoma for Better Treatment Selection) trial focuses on utilizing comprehensive\nmolecular profiling to guide treatment decisions for patients with advanced pancreatic can-\ncer. This trial aims to identify actionable mutations and stratify patients into subgroups that\nmay benefit from specific targeted therapies or clinical trial enrolment [76]. The IMPaCT\n(Integrative Molecular Profiling of Pancreatic Cancer Therapy) trial is another example,\naiming to match patients with targeted therapies based on the molecular characteristics of\ntheir tumors, allowing for more personalized treatment regimens [77].\nCombining immunotherapy with targeted therapy seems to be a promising approach,\nespecially in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer, as evidenced by several rele-\nvant studies. The KEYNOTE-158 Phase II study involved 22 patients with microsatellite\ninstability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors treated with pem-\nbrolizumab, resulting in an 18.2% response rate (RR), 2.1 months of progression-free\nsurvival (PFS), and 4 months overall survival (OS) [78]. The CODEBREAK-100 Phase Ib/II\nstudy included 38 patients with KRAS G12C mutations treated with sotorasib, showing\na 21% RR, 4 months PFS, and 6.9 months OS [79]. In the KRYSTAL-1 Phase II study,\n21 patients with KRAS G12C mutations received adagrasib, achieving a 33.3% RR, 5.4\nmonths PFS, and 8 months OS [80]. Schram’s 2021 Phase II study focused on 10 patients\nwith NRG1 fusions treated with zenocutuzumab, yielding a 40% RR [81]. Sacher’s 2023\nPhase I study reported a 36% RR for 22 patients with KRAS G12C mutations treated with\ndiravasib [82]. Li’s 2024 Phase I/II study on 24 patients with KRAS G12C mutations treated\nwith olomorasib demonstrated a 33% RR [83]. Finally, Hollebecque’s 2024 Phase I/II study\ninvolving 28 patients with KRAS G12C mutations treated with glecirasib reported a 46.4%\nRR and 5.5 months PFS [84].\nAlso, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is supporting a broad range of research\nprograms aimed at addressing pancreatic cancer more effectively, through different ap-\nproaches. These programs range from basic research exploring the biological underpinnings\nof cancer to clinical research seeking to translate these findings into improved patient out-\ncomes [76]. For example, the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium involves more than\na dozen prospective epidemiologic cohort studies investigating the causes and natural\nhistory of pancreatic cancer. This consortium includes the genome-wide association study\n(GWAS) known as PanScan. The Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC) focuses\non developing and testing biomarkers for early-stage pancreatic cancer detection and\nidentifying high-risk individuals.\nThe Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Stromal Reprogramming Consortium\n(PSRC) is a multidisciplinary community of researchers bridging biological research with\npreclinical and translational research. Their goal is to identify and evaluate elements in the\ntumor microenvironment that drive PDAC progression and response to therapy. Addition-\nally, the Pancreatic Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (Pancreatic SPOREs) are\ndesigned to quickly move basic scientific findings into clinical settings, supporting new\napproaches to the prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nThe RAS Initiative aims to understand mutations in RAS genes, which are implicated in\nover 90% of pancreatic cancers, to develop effective new therapies for RAS-related cancers.\nPredictive biomarkers such as genetic mutations (e.g., KRAS, BRCA1/2), gene expres-\nsion profiles, and protein markers (e.g., CA 19-9) guide patient stratification, facilitating the\nselection of optimal therapeutic agents [72,85,86].\nTargeting KRAS mutations indeed represents a significant advancement in the treat-\nment of PDAC. KRAS mutations, which occur in over 90% of PDAC cases, drive oncogenic\nsignaling pathways that promote tumor growth and survival. Recent therapeutic strategies\nthat specifically inhibit mutant KRAS have shown promising preclinical results, poten-\ntially transforming the therapeutic landscape for this aggressive cancer. The development\nof direct KRAS inhibitors, such as sotorasib (AMG 510) and adagrasib (MRTX849), has\ndemonstrated efficacy in early clinical trials, providing new hope for patients with KRAS-"}, {"page_number": 13, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n13 of 21\nmutant PDAC [87]. These breakthroughs highlight the potential of precision medicine to\nsignificantly improve outcomes.\nHowever, the successful integration of biomarker-driven approaches into clinical\ntrials faces several obstacles such as assay standardization, patient heterogeneity, and\nregulatory considerations. Overcoming these challenges requires collaborative efforts\nbetween researchers, clinicians, and regulatory agencies to establish robust biomarker\nvalidation processes and streamline their incorporation into clinical practice.\nDespite these challenges, biomarker-based clinical trials hold promise for improving\ntreatment efficacy, enhancing patient outcomes, and advancing the field of pancreatic\ncancer therapeutics. Recent research has highlighted the pivotal role of the ERK pathway\nin KRAS-mutated cell lines, revealing that its activation is crucial for tumor growth and\nsurvival, whereas the MAP pathway appears to be less significant [88].

As one of the many examples, in the\nclinical trial involving 1856 patients referred to the Know Your Tumor (KYT) program, 58%\nreceived personalized reports based on molecular testing. Among these, those with action-\nable alterations who received matched therapy showed significantly longer median overall\nsurvival compared to those receiving unmatched therapies (2.58 years vs. 1.51 years; HR\n0.42, p = 0.0004). These results highlight the importance of personalized treatment guided\nby molecular testing in improving overall survival among pancreatic cancer patients [89].\nThe KRAS gene mutation is identified in 90% of PDAC patients, facilitating tumori-\ngenesis through the MAP kinase pathway. Strategies to target the most common KRAS\nmutation, KRAS G12D, with specific inhibitors have shown limited efficacy. Recent studies\nindicate a correlation between RAS mutations and immunotherapy resistance, leading to\nobservations that combining inhibitors with immunotherapy yields favorable outcomes.\nInhibition of KRAS stimulates the Fas pathway, inducing cancer cell death and enhancing\nthe presence of T cells while reducing myeloid cells in tumors [90]. However, tumors\neventually recur, highlighting the need for a combination of more effective therapies with\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors for sustained tumor regression and improved survival [91].\nPancreatic cancer patients without KRAS mutations exhibit other actionable genetic alter-\nations, such as MSI/dMMR, BRAF mutations, and kinase-fusion genes, emphasizing the\nrole of precision oncology in identifying potential targets for tailored treatments [92].\nTumor mutational burden (TMB) is also emerging as a biomarker to predict response\nto immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In pancreatic cancer, just\nover 1% of patients exhibit a TMB-H phenotype, with about 60% of these having microsatel-\nlite instability (MSI-H). Hence, its role in pancreatic cancer remains less clear due to its\nlow prevalence. Continued research and consensus on TMB cut-off values are therefore\nnecessary to optimize its application in clinical settings [93].\nA few other new strategies are also currently being explored. A phase 1 clinical trial\nrecently assessed a chemoradiation regimen with nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, and radiation\nfor pancreatic cancer. The maximum tolerated dose of nab-paclitaxel was established at\n75 mg/m2. Among 23 patients, no grade 3 or 4 toxicities were seen at the lower doses, but\n5 patients at the maximum tolerated dose experienced grade 3 toxicities. Seven patients\nunderwent surgical resection. Median overall survival was 21.2 months, and progression-\nfree survival was 8.1 months. A more defined tumor interface response (IR) was associated\nwith better survival outcomes. These promising results therefore support the development\nof further trials and suggest IR could be a meaningful biomarker [94].\nAnother study evaluated serum albumin (b-alb) as a biomarker for bevacizumab\nin advanced pancreatic cancer. Data from 264 patients showed that those with normal\nb-alb (≥3.4 g/dL) treated with bevacizumab had significantly better outcomes: median\noverall survival of 10.2 months versus 4.1 months (p = 0.0001) and median time to disease\nprogression of 6.2 months versus 3.7 months (p = 0.0488). These results suggest that normal\nb-alb can predict benefits from bevacizumab, which is essential to select patients based on\nb-alb levels for better treatment outcomes [95].\nGenetic variations combined with traditional tumor markers can improve pancreatic\ncancer detection. Incorporating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with\nCA19-9, CEA, and CA-125 levels increased sensitivity in identifying pancreatic ductal ade-\nnocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. However, combining markers slightly reduced specificity,\nsuggesting that SNP information could enhance diagnostic accuracy for pancreatic cancer,\npotentially aiding in early detection and treatment decisions [96].\nGermline BRCA testing and treatment strategies significantly impact health outcomes\nin metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. Among patients with gBRCAm, almost twice as"}, {"page_number": 15, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n15 of 21\nmany received platinum-based regimens with early testing strategies compared to no early\ntesting (78.7% vs. 40.2%). Health outcomes, measured by progression-free life years (PF\nLYs), overall life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), were significantly\nhigher in the early testing with available olaparib treatment scenario compared to other\nstrategies (PF LYs: 1.27 vs. 0.55–0.87; LYs: 1.82 vs. 0.95–1.27; QALYs: 1.15 vs. 0.73–0.92) [97].\nDespite the potential advantages of biomarker testing, its widespread utilization in\nclinical practice presents several challenges. One major obstacle is the low rate of treatment\ninitiation among pancreatic cancer patients, with only 45% of patients receiving any form\nof treatment after diagnosis. This therefore leads to the need to improve awareness,\naccess, and acceptance of biomarker-guided therapies among patients and healthcare\nproviders alike. Additionally, there is a discrepancy in the uptake of germline testing, with\nonly 30–50% of patients undergoing testing for inherited genetic mutations. Managing\nthese barriers requires multiple efforts to enhance testing accessibility, streamline testing\nprotocols, and integrate genetic counseling into routine care. To overcome these challenges\nand enhance the routine implementation of biomarker testing in pancreatic cancer care,\nseveral measures have been recommended. Reflexive Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)\nand RNA testing should be evaluated for all pancreatic cancer patients at the time of\ndiagnosis. Similar to standard practices in breast cancer care, where testing for hormone\nreceptor status and HER2 expression is reflexive, labeling pancreatic cancer specimens as\n“likely pancreatic cancer” could prompt automatic biomarker testing, ensuring timely and\ncomprehensive analysis of genetic alterations. Additionally, universal germline testing\nshould be incorporated as a standard practice for all pancreatic cancer patients, consistent\nwith existing guidelines recommending genetic evaluation for hereditary cancer syndromes.\nSystems should be established to facilitate the collection of blood or saliva samples for\ngermline testing at the initial patient visit, with cascade testing strategies utilized to identify\nat-risk family members and enable early intervention.\nRole of Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is still one of\nthe deadliest types of cancer worldwide, highlighting the need for better treatment choices.\nWhile immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment paradigms in various malignancies\nwith significant survival benefits, pancreatic cancer has largely remained refractory to\nthese advances. Current treatments primarily rely on chemotherapies, which offer mod-\nest benefits. Because pancreatic malignancies are immune-cold tumors, clinical trials of\nimmunotherapies have shown a limited response [98].\nThe immune-cold nature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is attributed\nto its dense desmoplastic stroma, a physical barrier to immune cell infiltration, and its im-\nmunosuppressive microenvironment. Regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages,\nand cancer-associated fibroblasts collaborate to create this immunosuppressive milieu,\nwhich inhibits effective immune responses [99]. Consequently, immune checkpoint in-\nhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated minimal improvements in patient outcomes. However, a\nsubset of patients does benefit from these therapies, underscoring the need for predictive\nbiomarkers and a deeper understanding of resistance mechanisms [98].\nFor patients with mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability (MSI) who\nhave pancreatic cancer, only anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies have FDA\napproval. Despite this approval, the broader application of immunotherapy in pancreatic\ncancer remains challenging due to its overall low tumor mutational burden and complex\ntumor microenvironment [99,100].\nA variety of current clinical trials are investigating different immunotherapy strategies,\nincluding combinations with other immunotherapy agents, targeted treatments, stroma-\naltering drugs, and chemotherapy. In PDAC patients with MSI-high status, for instance,\npembrolizumab has shown notable radiographic responses [101]. Anti-PD-1 is being\ninvestigated intensively by researchers in conjunction with CAR T cells, pathway inhibitors,\nother immune checkpoint inhibitors, and cancer vaccines [102,103]. These combination\ntreatments seek to increase T-cell recruitment and improve immune checkpoint inhibitor\nefficacy [99]."}, {"page_number": 16, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n16 of 21\nCutting-edge immunotherapy techniques are currently under investigation, such as\nthe utilization of oncolytic viruses, modification of T-cell receptors, the application of CAR\nT-cell therapy, the use of CAR natural killer cells, and the stimulation of cytokine-induced\nkiller cells. These strategies are specifically developed to address various components of\nthe tumor microenvironment (TME) and to tackle the obstacles posed by immunosuppres-\nsion [104]. In addition, advanced methods such as single-cell sequencing and multi-omics\nanalysis are being used to gain a deeper understanding of the composition of immune cells\nin pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This research has the potential to pave the\nway for the creation of innovative and powerful immunotherapies [104].\nDespite the promising preclinical results, significant challenges remain. The dense\nfibrotic TME and immune escape mechanisms continue to limit the effectiveness of im-\nmunotherapies in clinical settings. Refining existing immunotherapies and validating novel\ntargets through human clinical trials is crucial. The incorporation of advanced research\nfields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and CRISPR/Cas-based technologies\npresents new opportunities for revolutionary advancements in immunotherapy for pancre-\natic cancer [104–106].\nIn conclusion, while the current role of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer is lim-\nited, ongoing research and innovative approaches hold promise for future advancements.\nContinued efforts to elucidate the mechanisms of immune resistance and develop effec-\ntive combination therapies are essential to harness the potential of immunotherapy in\nimproving outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.\nCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential treatment target. Over the past\nfew years, there has been a lot of focus on the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)\nin tumorigenesis. CAFs, an essential element of the tumor microenvironment, have a\nsignificant impact on advancing cancer growth and resistance to treatment through a\nrange of mechanisms. Research has indicated that CAFs and cancer cells have a complex\nrelationship, where they influence each other in a way that promotes tumor growth,\nangiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy [107–110].\nCAFs have been implicated in the initiation of epithelial tumor formation and are\nknown to release regulatory factors that support tumor growth and metastasis [107]. They\nexhibit pro-tumorigenic functions, modulating the tumor microenvironment through di-\nverse mechanisms and supporting tumor progression [108]. Despite their heterogeneity\nand plasticity, CAFs are considered a potential target for cancer treatment, with preclinical\nand clinical trials suggesting their importance in solid tumors [107–109,111].\nTargeting CAFs as a therapeutic strategy has shown promise in preclinical studies.\nRecent advances in therapies targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) include DNA-\nbased vaccines, anti-CAF CAR-T cells, and strategies for modifying and reprogramming\nCAF functions. These approaches are being explored in clinical trials to determine their\nefficacy in treating various cancers by targeting the supportive role CAFs play in tumor\ngrowth and progression. However, translating these findings into clinical practice remains\na challenge [108]. Various approaches, including reducing, eliminating, or reprogramming\nCAFs, have been explored, but their effectiveness in human clinical trials against different\ncancer types, including melanoma, breast cancer, pancreas cancer, and colorectal cancers,\nhas been limited [108]. Challenges such as CAF heterogeneity, lack of specific target markers,\nand off-target effects need to be addressed to develop safe and effective CAF-targeting\ntherapies [108,109,111].\nDespite these challenges, understanding the biology of CAFs and their interactions\nwith cancer cells provides valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies.\nTargeting CAFs could potentially improve cancer treatments by disrupting the tumor-\nstroma crosstalk and enhancing the efficacy of existing therapies [109,110]. In conclusion,\nCAFs represent a promising target for cancer therapy, with their role in tumorigenesis\nand therapy resistance increasingly recognized. Further research is needed to unravel the\ncomplexities of CAF biology and develop effective CAF-targeting therapies for improving\ncancer treatment outcomes."}, {"page_number": 17, "text": "Cancers 2024, 16, 2329\n17 of 21\nIn conclusion, biomarker testing represents a crucial aspect of personalized medicine\nin pancreatic cancer care, offering the potential to tailor treatment strategies based on\nindividual genetic profiles.

Although early surgical\nresection is the preferred treatment for these tumors (2), most\npatients are already in an advanced stage at diagnosis and less than\n20% cases are suitable for surgical resection (3). The prognosis of\npatients with advanced disease is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of\nonly 5% (4, 5). Pancreatic cancer includes various pathological types\nincluding ductal adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, and small\ncell carcinoma, among others (6). Ductal adenocarcinoma is the\nmost common histological type, and accounts for over 90% of all\ncases. As per new estimates, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) was projected to account for 3% of cancer incidence in\n2023, with an estimated mortality rate of 8% (7). In this context, the\nmortality from pancreatic cancer has not decreased signiﬁcantly\nowing to delayed diagnosis, early metastasis, and limited efﬁcacy of\nchemotherapy or radiotherapy; systemic chemotherapy remains\none of the main treatment options (8–10). Gemcitabine-based\nchemotherapy is currently the standard for metastatic pancreatic\nductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) (11). Although combined\ngemcitabine and oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and\nﬂuorouracil have all been found to reduce patient mortality, and\nthe modiﬁed FOLFIRINOX (5-ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan,\nand oxaliplatin) regimen has slightly improved survival in these\npatients, the 5-year survival rate remains at approximately 8% (12,\n13). It is therefore essential to identify more effective treatments for\nthis condition.\nSurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the traditional\ntreatment options for pancreatic cancer (14). However, the tumors\nare usually beyond the scope of surgery in the advanced stages and\nthe beneﬁts from radiotherapy and chemotherapy are limited.\nImmunotherapy has increasingly gained attention for the\ntreatment of pancreatic cancer owing to its speciﬁc effects on\npancreatic cancer (15, 16). It is currently considered the fourth\nmajor modality for the treatment of these cancers (17), and is widely\nused in clinical practice in conjunction with traditional modalities\n(Figure 1). Reports indicate that tumor immunotherapy was ﬁrst\nemployed in the 1890s (18). William Coley was the ﬁrst to\nadminister an intratumoral injection of bacterial extracts to treat\ntumors. In 1967, Lindenmann and Klein (19) found that inﬂuenza\nvirus-infected tumor cells could induce an anti-tumor response in\nhost cells on inoculation into mice. Subsequent studies have\nincreasingly conﬁrmed the important role of the human immune\nsystem in the initiation and development of malignant tumors (20).\nTherefore, the role of immunotherapy in clinical practice has\nbecome increasingly prominent, and it has become an important\nbreakthrough in the ﬁeld of pancreatic cancer treatment. In\naddition, pancreatic cancer is often accompanied by immune\nescape and immunosuppression, and the effect of traditional\ntreatment methods is limited (21). Immunotherapy is a treatment\nthat activates the body’s immune system to ﬁght tumors. It can kill\ntumor cells and control tumor development by stimulating and\nenhancing the patient’s immune response (22, 23). At present,\ndrugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in pancreatic\ncancer immunotherapy have shown certain activity in clinical\ntrials, and personalized immunotherapy strategies such as\nadoptive cell therapy and vaccine therapy are also being\ndeveloped (24, 25). In addition, the ﬁeld of pancreatic cancer\nimmunotherapy is constantly exploring new potential biomarkers\nand immunotherapy combinations to improve the therapeutic\neffect. The in-depth research on the immune escape mechanism\nof pancreatic cancer and the development of targeted therapy will\nprovide broader prospects for the application of immunotherapy in\nthe treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nResearch indicates that pancreatic cancer has an unique\nimmunosuppressive microenvironment (26), with extremely low T-\ncell inﬁltration and a relatively low mutation rate. These factors lead\nto successful immune tolerance in pancreatic cancer cells, and\nfacilitate escape from the host immune system (27). Notably, the\ntumor microenvironment (TME) plays a key role in the occurrence,\ndevelopment, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. This affects tumor\ngrowth and plays a key role in drug therapy and immune checkpoint\ninhibitors (ICIs) resistance (28). Coordination between various\nimmune cells is necessary for achieving an effective anti-tumor\nimmune response against pancreatic cancer (29, 30). These cells\ninclude cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, T helper cells, mature dendritic cells\n(DCs), macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, among others.\nHowever, various mechanisms have evolved to inhibit immune\nFIGURE 1\nSchematic diagram of several methods commonly used in the clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n02"}, {"page_number": 3, "text": "responses during the onset and development of pancreatic cancer.\nThese result in the formation of an immunosuppressive\nmicroenvironment, which limits the activation and function of\nimmune cells in the TME (31). This phenomenon has considerable\nimpact on the clinical effects of immunotherapy and has become an\nimportant limiting factor for its success in pancreatic cancer. It is\ntherefore essential to urgently identify new therapeutic methods or\ntechniques for improving the prognosis of these patients.\nThis review summarizes the various approaches commonly\nused in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the clinic, and\nexplores some new potential biomarkers and immunotherapy\ncombinations. With particular emphasis on the molecular\nmechanisms of action of ICIs, cancer vaccines, adoptive cell\ntherapy (ACT), oncolytic virotherapy, and matrix-depleting\ntherapy (Figure 2). Findings from the latest in-depth studies on\nthe clinical application of these therapies and recent progress made\nin the ﬁeld have also been discussed. In addition, the current\nfrontiers and future of immunotherapy in this cancer type have\nbeen described and strategies have been suggested to overcome\nexisting limitations.\n2 ICIs\nICIs represent a revolutionary form of cancer immunotherapy\n(32), that enhance anticancer immune responses by targeting\nimmune receptors on the surface of T lymphocytes (33). The\nprogrammed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1\n(PD-L1) (34, 35) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4\n(CTLA-4) immune checkpoints have gained considerable attention\nin the treatment of pancreatic cancer (36). PD-L1 is usually\nexpressed by pancreatic cancer cells (37), and may potentially\ninhibit T-cell activity by binding to PD-1. Inhibition of the\ninteraction between PD-1 and PD-L1 (38), or the inhibition of\nCTLA-4, can activate T cells (39) and enhance the immune attack\non pancreatic cancer cells. The discovery of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and\nanti-CTLA-4 has led to deﬁnite changes in the ﬁeld of cancer\nimmunotherapy (36). However, the use of these targets is also\nassociated with various advantages and disadvantages (Figure 3).\nAnti-PD-1/PD-L1 can enhance the immune attack on cancer cells\nand is suitable for a variety of cancer types (40, 41); this ensures\nmaintenance of long-term efﬁcacy after drug withdrawal. However,\nFIGURE 2\nSchematic illustration of the molecular mechanisms of relevant immunotherapies for pancreatic cancer. (A) After binding to PD-1 or PD-L1, ICIs\nblock the binding of tumor cells to T cells, thereby maintaining the tumor-killing activity of T cells and acting on pancreatic cancer. (B) Tumor\nantigens are delivered into patients in a variety of forms, such as autologous tumor cells, tumor-associated proteins or peptides, and dendritic cells\nas delivery vectors. After the vaccine enters the body, tumor antigens are phagocytosed by dendritic cells, which are then processed and presented\nto T cells to activate antigen-speciﬁc cytotoxic T cells, thereby killing pancreatic cancer. (C) The patient’s own immune cells were collected,\ngenetically modiﬁed, and cultured in vitro, and then returned to the patient’s body to act on pancreatic cancer. (D) Oncolytic viruses replicate in\ntumor cells and can speciﬁcally infect and lyse tumor cells. In addition, the expression of viral antigens induces an antiviral immune response that\ncan help destroy pancreatic cancer cells. 2E, Extracellular matrix-modiﬁed pancreatic cancer cells. Normally, pancreatic epithelial cells are\nsurrounded by extracellular matrix (ECM), ﬁbroblasts, and blood vessels to provide structural and nutritional support. However, during tumorigenesis,\nmolecules such as tumor growth factors (such as TGF-b) or Hedgehog (SHH) activate intracellular signaling, leading cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts to\nenhance ECM deposition. Forming a tumor microenvironment conducive to the growth and spread of pancreatic cancer. However, by blocking this\npathway, it is possible to establish a more beneﬁcial and healthy tumor microenvironment.\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n03"}, {"page_number": 4, "text": "this is associated with certain disadvantages and may lead to the\ndevelopment of side effects owing to possible triggering of the\nimmune system (42), which may attack normal tissues and cause\ndrug resistance in some cases. In the case of anti-CTLA-4, the initial\nimmune response may be enhanced (43); this may prompt the\nimmune system to attack cancer cells earlier and potentially lead to\nlong-term efﬁcacy. However, the efﬁcacy of anti-CTLA-4 is\nrelatively limited in some cancer types. This often necessitates the\nuse of combination therapy (44, 45), which also has side effects.\nTherefore, although ICIs provide a new approach for the treatment\nof pancreatic cancer, it is essential to consider the patient condition\nto optimize treatment outcomes. Current research on ICIs mainly\nfocuses on molecules such as anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 and anti-\nCTLA-4 agents (Table 1). The mechanism of action and clinical\napplications of each inhibitor have been discussed below.\n2.1 Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 inhibitors\nPD-1 is an inhibitory receptor for T cells, which is mainly\nexpressed on the surface of activated T, B, and NK cells (46). PD-1\nhas two ligands, namely, PD-L1 and PD-L2 (47), of which PD-L1 is the\nmajor ligand. Notably, PD-L1 is expressed by different cell types\nincluding those of many different tumors (48). The combination of\nPD-1 and PD-L1 also inhibits T cell proliferation and reduces T cell\nsurvival; this allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance (49). In\nthis context, the PD-L1 gene is a proto-oncogene that is involved in the\noccurrence and development of pancreatic cancer. It is upregulated in\nthis condition and is associated with tumor progression and poor\nprognosis (50, 51). PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are currently approved by\nthe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the clinical\ntreatment of a variety of malignant tumors (52).\nThe PD-1 inhibitors mainly include nivolumab, pembrolizumab,\nand cemiplimab, among others (53, 54). Studies on the treatment of\npancreatic cancer have found that the efﬁcacy of PD-1/PD-L1\ninhibitors may be improved by combining with other therapies.\nIn this context, an efﬁcacy analysis of data (55) from 105 patients\n(included in a randomized phase II trial that evaluated sotigalimab and/\nor nivolumab plus chemotherapy in ﬁrst-line metastatic pancreatic\ncancer) showed that the primary endpoint of 1-year overall survival\n(OS) was met in the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm (57.7%, P = 0.006).\nThe historical 1-year OS was 35% (n = 34); this indicated that\nnivolumab combination therapy is effective in metastatic pancreatic\ncancer. Another phase I trial (56) that evaluated outcomes with\nnivolumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in 98\npatients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, found\nthe median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS to be 5.5 and 9.9\nmonths, respectively. This indicated that the combination was safe in\nadvanced pancreatic cancer and the adverse events were manageable.\nFor the treatment of refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer, one study\nlooked at 84 patients (57), of whom 41 received stereotactic body\nradiation therapy (SBRT) with nivolumab and 43 received SBRT with\nnivolumab and ipilimumab. The results showed that 17.1%(8.0 to 30.6)\nof the patients who received SBRT plus nivolumab had a beneﬁt. In\ncontrast, 37.2%(24.0 to 52.1) of patients who received SBRT with\nnivolumab and ipilimumab had a beneﬁt. One patient who received\nSBRT plus nivolumab had a 4.6 month partial response. Overall, this\nstudy conﬁrms that SBRT combined with nivolumab and ipilimumab\nhas potential value in terms of antitumor activity and safety. However,\nthe speciﬁc mechanism of SBRT is still unclear, and further in-depth\nstudies are needed. Humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibodies\n(represented by pembrolizumab) play an important role in\ndisrupting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (58). Based on the robust\nobjective responses and excellent pharmacokinetics and safety data,\npembrolizumab has received FDA approval for the treatment of\nvarious tumor types (59), including pancreatic cancer (60). However,\npembrolizumab is applicable to only a minority of patients with\npancreatic cancer, because not all patients have tumors that express\nPD-L1, and the heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer limits its efﬁcacy\n(61). This indicates that the individual condition of the patient and the\ncharacteristics of the tumor should be considered comprehensively in\nthe treatment selection.\nFIGURE 3\nAdvantages and disadvantages of immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer and the modes of action of combined immunotherapy in these cases.\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n04"}, {"page_number": 5, "text": "Notably, pelareorep (62), an intravenously delivered oncolytic\nreovirus, is known to induce a T-cell inﬂammatory phenotype in\nPDAC. A phase Ib study (63) that evaluated pembrolizumab\ncombined with pelareorep and chemotherapy included 11\npatients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Efﬁcacy of the\ncombination was demonstrated in 10 patients, among whom 3\nexperienced disease control. One patient demonstrated partial\nresponse for up to 17.4 months; the 2 other patients had stable\ndisease for 9 and 4 months, respectively. These results demonstrated\nthat the addition of pelareorep and pembrolizumab to\nchemotherapy offered good efﬁcacy without any signiﬁcant\nincrease in toxicity. However, another open-label randomized\ncontrolled phase 2 trial (64) compared SBRT plus pembrolizumab\nand trametinib with SBRT plus gemcitabine for locally recurrent\npancreatic cancer (after surgical resection). Among 198 patients\nwho underwent screening, 170 were enrolled and randomly\nassigned to receive SBRT plus either pembrolizumab and\ntrametinib or SBRT plus gemcitabine. Serious adverse events were\nreported in both the SBRT plus pembrolizumab and trametinib\ngroup and the SBRT plus gemcitabine group. However, no\ntreatment-related deaths were observed. These results suggest that\nthe combination of SBRT with pembrolizumab and trametinib may\nrepresent a novel treatment option for patients with locally\nrecurrent pancreatic cancer following surgery. Although a phase 3\ntrial is needed for further validation, this study offers promising\ndirections for future treatment. In this context, the FDA approved\nanother PD-1 inhibitor, namely, cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo), on\nFebruary 22, 2021 for the ﬁrst-line treatment of advanced non-\nsmall cell lung cancer (65) with high PD-L1 expression (tumor\nproportion score ≥50%); it was approved for either metastatic or\nlocally advanced cases without EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutations.\nHowever, a few clinical trials have evaluated the use of cemiplimab\nfor the treatment of pancreatic cancer (66). There is a need for\nfurther in-depth research in this area.\nPD-L1 inhibitors prevent tumor cells from being disguised as\nnormal cells, and thereby facilitate their killing by T cells (67, 68). In\nthis context, most PD-L1 inhibitors are IgG1 antibodies. IgG1\nfacilitates recognition of pathogenic antigens and can recognize\nPD-L1 expressed on the surface of tumor cells (69). The well-\nknown PD-L1 inhibitors include avelumab, durvalumab, and\natezolizumab (54, 70). Numerous clinical studies have found that\nalthough some tumors show high PD-L1 expression (71), PD-L1\nmonoclonal antibodies do not offer optimal therapeutic effect. A\nmore comprehensive treatment regimen has therefore been explored\nin a phase Ib trial (72). Trials on avelumab or talazoparib plus\nbinimetinib in mPDAC have shown promising additive or synergistic\nantitumor activity. Durvalumab is another humanized IgG1\nmonoclonal antibody (73) that targets PD-L1 and activates anti-\ntumor immunity by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and its\nreceptor, PD-1. It was ﬁrst approved by the FDA in 2017 for the\ntreatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (74)\nand stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (75).

The\nscope of single-agent immunotherapies is also limited to mismatch-\nrepair deﬁciencies. These ﬁndings suggest that the use of dual\ncheckpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy may be\nsafe and effective in a speciﬁc range of tumors.\nThe IgG1 monoclonal antibody, atezolizumab, was designed\nwith Fc domain modiﬁcation to reduce antibody-mediated\ncytotoxicity and thereby prevent PD-L1-expressing T-cell\ndepletion. Although research on the use of atezolizumab for\npancreatic cancer is limited, the agent has shown promising\nefﬁcacy in other tumor types including, metastatic breast cancer\n(77), and advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma (78). The positive\noutcomes in these tumors have considerably increased interest in its\npotential use for pancreatic cancer. More relevant studies are\nneeded in the future to understand the potential effects of\natezolizumab in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n2.2 CTLA-4 inhibitors\nCTLA-4 (CD152) plays an important role in the human\nimmune system and is mainly expressed by activated CD4+/CD8+\nT cells and CD25+/FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. Although CTLA-4 is\nhomologous to CD28, it can interact with B7-1/B7-2 with higher\nafﬁnity. In addition, it can regulate or even inhibit CD28 signal\ntransduction, and thereby inhibit the activity of effector T cells (79–\n81). It can also reduce the production of interleukin-2, which may\nactivate regulatory T cells and thereby weaken the immune\nresponse; this may in turn inhibit an anti-tumor immune\nresponse (82). The CTLA-4 inhibitors currently in common use\ninclude ipilimumab and tremelimumab (83), both of which have\nbeen tested in clinical trials. The data from clinical trials on these\nagents have been described below.\nIpilimumab treatment of melanoma prolongs patients’ survival\nby 4 months (84). In 2011, the FDA approved ipilimumab for the\ntreatment of advanced melanoma (85), which opened a new era of\nimmunotherapy in cancer treatment.\nIn the context of pancreatic cancer, a phase Ib study (86) that\nincluded 21 patients had evaluated the use of ipilimumab plus\ngemcitabine for the treatment of advanced PDAC, 3, 10, and 8\npatients demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and disease\nprogression, respectively. The objective response rate was found to\nbe 14% (3/21) and the median PFS and OS were 2.78 and 6.9\nmonths, respectively. These results further suggest that the use of\ngemcitabine and ipilimumab is both safe and feasible in advanced\npancreatic cancer. However, it is worth noting that adding\nipilimumab to gemcitabine does not appear to be more effective\nthan gemcitabine alone in these cases. In this context, a phase II\nstudy (87) that tested the efﬁcacy of granulocyte-macrophage\ncolony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-allogeneic pancreatic tumor\ncells (GVAX) and ipilimumab in mPDAC found that maintenance\ntreatment with the combination did not improve OS after\ncontinuation of chemotherapy; in addition, the results were\nnumerically worse in mPDAC. However, both clinical responses\nand biological effects (on immune cells) were observed. It is\ntherefore necessary to further investigate new combinations of\nmaintenance therapy for mPDAC. Overall, combination therapy\nwarrants further investigation in pancreatic cancer.\nTremelimumab, another CTLA-4 inhibitor, is a fully\nhumanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4. Studies\nhave reported on its anti-tumor effects in malignant tumors\nincluding melanoma (88), liver cancer (89), and colorectal cancer\n(90). In a phase Ib trial (91), tremelimumab combined with\ngemcitabine showed some success in the treatment of metastatic\npancreatic cancer. Among the 34 included patients, 2 demonstrated\npartial response and a median OS of 7.4 months. These results\ndemonstrate the safety and tolerability of this combination and\nwarrant further study in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.\nIn this context, the use of combination therapy is currently\npreferred because of the immunosuppressive microenvironment\nof pancreatic cancer, which makes it often difﬁcult to obtain optimal\nefﬁcacy with CTLA-4 inhibitors alone. The future direction of\ntreatment requires the combination of chemotherapy and\nradiotherapy with immunotherapy in order to achieve better\ntherapeutic effects.\nRecently, unique barriers to the effectiveness of ICIs in\npancreatic cancer include the following: First, PD-1/PD-L1\ninhibitors are not suitable for all patients, as some have poor\nresponses to them. In addition, the use of these drugs may trigger\nimmune-related side effects, causing the immune system to attack\nnormal tissues, and the problem of drug resistance may arise.\nSimilarly, CTLA-4 inhibitors also trigger immune-related side\neffects that may cause the immune system to attack normal\ntissues. In addition, due to its poor speciﬁcity, it may have\nadverse effects on normal tissues. The efﬁcacy of this treatment in\nsome types of cancer is relatively limited, and it often needs to be\nused in combination with other treatments.\n3 Cancer vaccines\nOver the past decade, considerable progress has been made in\nthe use of cancer vaccines for solid tumors (25). They represent one\nof the most widely studied types of tumor immunotherapy,\nespecially for pancreatic cancer (61, 92). In this context,\ndevelopment of the tumor leads to a gradual weakening of the\nmonitoring and recognition ability of the immune system; this\nallows tumor cells to escape immune clearance. However, tumor\nvaccines can stimulate the expansion, ampliﬁcation, or activation of\ntumor-speciﬁc T/B cells via active immunization (93), and thereby\nenhance the anti-immune response to tumors; this facilitates\nspeciﬁc killing of tumor cells.\nVaccine-based anticancer immunotherapy aims to harness the\nability to recognize and respond effectively to novel antigens (94).\nTherapeutic vaccines for pancreatic cancer currently include whole-\ncell, peptide, and DC vaccines. Each of the three vaccines have\nunique advantages and limitations (Figure 3). Whole-cell vaccines\nare suitable for a wide variety of tumors and have multi-\nantigenicity, but their use is limited by the issues of immune\ntolerance and autoimmune reactions (95). In contrast, peptide\nvaccines are speciﬁc and reduce the risk of autoimmune reactions\n(96–98); however, their use is limited by antigen- and major\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n06"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related constraints. DC\nvaccines can effectively stimulate and regulate the immune system\n(99) and may be potentially used for individualized treatment;\nhowever, their preparation involves a complex process and is\nexpensive. As the ﬁeld of immunotherapy continues to advance,\nclinical studies on these vaccines will provide key insights into the\ntreatment of pancreatic cancer (Table 2). The mechanism of action\nof these three advanced vaccine types and their clinical application\nhave been described in the subsequent sections.\n3.1 Whole-cell vaccines\nWhole-cell vaccines prime the patient immune system to attack\npancreatic cancer cells. The process involves the presentation of\ncancer cell antigens by antigen-presenting cells and the activation of\nCD8+ T cells that directly kill the cancer cells; the CD4+ T cells\nprovide helper signals. Vaccines are prepared using homologous\ncells or engineered cell lines and are combined with immune\nadjuvants to improve efﬁcacy (100–103). This approach facilitates\nthe removal of cancer cells and the formation of immune memory.\nIn a preclinical study, high levels of expression of GM-CSF was\nfound to stimulate durable antitumor activity with vaccine-based\ntherapy (104). The GVAX vaccine was therefore developed for\ntreating pancreatic cancer. It is an allogeneic, irradiated, whole-cell-\nbased tumor vaccine which includes two pancreatic cancer cell lines\nthat were engineered to express GM-CSF and irradiated to prevent\nfurther cell division. The vaccine was developed with the aim of\nstimulating a comprehensive immune response and providing a\nwider range of immunotherapy options for patients with pancreatic\ncancer (105). In the early 1990s, the allogeneic GVAX tumor\nvaccine was found to demonstrate a favorable safety proﬁle in a\nphase I study (106) on PDAC. Three patients who received ≥10 ×\n107 vaccine cells showed increased delayed hypersensitivity to\nautologous tumor cells. Based on these promising results, a trial\n(107) evaluated the use of cyclophosphamide (Cy)/GVAX+CRS-\n207 (live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes mesothelin expressing\ncells) with or without nivolumab. Although the combination did\nnot signiﬁcantly improve OS, an objective response was observed\nand the OS remained comparable to that obtained with existing\ntherapies. In addition, signiﬁcant immunological changes were\ninduced in the TME. Further research is therefore warranted in\nthis regard, and related combined treatment strategies need to be\nexplored to improve the therapeutic effect.\nAlgenpantucel-L is another hyperacute rejection-based\nallogeneic pancreatic cancer vaccine, which consists of two PDAC\ncell lines (HAPa-1 and HAPa-2) that are genetically engineered to\nexpress a-galactose epitopes on membrane glycoproteins and\nTABLE 2 Preclinical studies and clinical trials based on cancer vaccines for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nType of immunotherapy\nClinicalTrials.\nGov Identiﬁer\nCombinatorial Agent(s)\nPhase\nEndpoint\nStatus\nWhole-Cell Vaccines\nNCT02243371\nGVAX pancreas vaccines;\nCy; CRS-207; Nivolumab\n/\nOS, PFS\nCompleted\nWhole-Cell Vaccines\nNCT01072981\nAlgenpantucel-L\nPhase 2\nDFS, OS\nActive\nWhole-Cell Vaccines\nNCT01836432\nAlgenpantucel-L, FOLFIRINOX,\nGemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel\nPhase 3\nOS\nTerminated\nPeptide Vaccines\n/\nGM-CSF,\nGemcitabine,\nGV1001\n/\nDTH,\nProliferation,\nELISPOT\nCompleted\nPeptide Vaccines\nISRCTN4382138\nGemcitabine,\nCapecitabine,\nGV1001\nPhase 3\nOS\nCompleted\nPeptide Vaccines\n/\nMUC-1\nPhase 1\nMOS,\nCompleted\nPeptide Vaccines\n/\nMUC-1,WT1,\nChemotherapy\nPhase I/II\nMOS,OS\nCompleted\nPeptide Vaccines\nNCT02261714\nTG01/GM-CSF,\nGemcitabine\nPhase 1/2\nOS,DFS\nCompleted\nDC vaccines\n/\nLAK, Gemcitabine,\nS-1, DC vaccine\n/\nOS\nCompleted\nDC vaccines\nNCT01410968\nPoly-ICLC, DC\n/\nSafety,\nFeasibility\nCompleted\nDC vaccines\nNCT01781520\nDC-CIK, (CT) S-1\nProspective Study\nOS, PFS\nCompleted\nDisease-free survival (DFS), GM-CSF-secreting allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells (GVAX pancreas vaccine), cyclophosphamide (Cy), live, attenuated Listeria monocytogenes-expressing\nmesothelin (CRS-207), NewLink Genetics Corporation, Ames, IA (algenpantucel-L), disease-free survival (DFS), neoadjuvant SOC chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-\npaclitaxel),16-amino acid telomerase peptide (GV1001), Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay (ELISPOT), mucin-1 (MUC-1), median overall survival\n(MOS), Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), cancer immunotherapy (TG01), lymphokine-activated killer (LAK), toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 agonist (Poly-ICLC), dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer\ncells (DC-CIK).\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n07"}, {"page_number": 8, "text": "glycolides (108); these lead to hyperacute rejection and thereby kill\ntumor cells. In a phase II trial (109) that evaluated algenpantucel-L\nplus gemcitabine or 5-ﬂuorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy in\npatients with resected pancreatic cancer, the addition of\nalgenpantucel-L improved survival compared with standard\nadjuvant therapy, offering a median PFS of 62% and OS of 86%\nat 12 months. This compares with the rates of 45% and 65%,\nrespectively, that were reported in a previous study. These results\nfurther suggest that in combination with chemotherapy,\nalgenpantucel-L is effective in treating patients with pancreatic\ncancer. In order to further explore the mechanism of action,\nanother randomized clinical trial (110) included patients with\nPDAC. The patients were assigned to receive either standard\nchemoradiotherapy or standard neoadjuvant therapy plus\nalgenpantucel-L (HyperAcute-Pancreas) immunotherapy. The\nresults showed that 75% of patients in the standard group\nexperienced adverse events of grade 3 or higher, while 81% of\npatients in the experimental group experienced similar adverse\nevents; however, no signiﬁcant difference was observed between\nthe two groups. Although algenpantucel-L did not achieve the\nexpected outcomes in this trial, its potential efﬁcacy as a new\noption in the ﬁeld of pancreatic cancer treatment warrants further\ninvestigation. Future trials may help to further evaluate its actual\nimpact and potential role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, and\nthereby provide more treatment options for affected patients.\n3.2 Peptide vaccines\nPeptide vaccines contain speciﬁc antigen fragments (111)\ndirected against surface antigens of pancreatic cancer cells (112,\n113). These antigen fragments may be presented to T cells by\nantigen-presenting cells; the subsequent activation of CD8+ T cells\ninduces them to attack cancer cells. The activated T cells then\nproliferate to form more effector T cells that are capable of\nrecognizing cancer cells (111). Finally, peptide vaccines help\nestablish immune memory and provide patients with long-term\nprotection against pancreatic cancer (114, 115). The involved\nprocess allows the patient immune system to mount a long-\nlasting immune response that is vigilant for the presence of\npancreatic cancer.\nAnother cancer vaccine, namely, GV1001, is currently under\nclinical investigation for telomerase overexpression in pancreatic\ncancer; the vaccine contains a telomerase-derived peptide of 16\namino acids (116). In this context, a study (117) had used GV1001\nin combination with GM-CSF (an immunostimulant) and\ngemcitabine as ﬁrst-line therapy to investigate its safety and\nimmunogenicity in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.\nThe preliminary results indicated that GV1001 performed well in\nterms of safety when combined with chemotherapy, and patients\ndeveloped telomerase-speciﬁc immune responses. These ﬁndings\nsupport the use of GV1001 as a potential therapeutic strategy,\nespecially in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However,\nin another important phase 3 trial (118) (where patients with locally\nadvanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer were administered\ncombined gemcitabine and capecitabine), the addition of GV1001\noffered no signiﬁcant improvement in OS compared with\nchemotherapy alone. This suggests that new strategies are needed\nto enhance the immune response to telomerase vaccines during\nchemotherapy, as this may improve clinical efﬁcacy.\nMucin-1 (MUC-1) is a type I transmembrane protein that\npromotes tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (119, 120).\nNotably, MUC-1 expression levels have been reported to be elevated\nin more than 60% of patients with pancreatic cancer, and the levels\nhave been found to signiﬁcantly correlate with tumor size (121). In\naddition, high MUC-1 expression is associated with poor prognosis\nin pancreatic cancer (122). In one of the therapeutic strategies\nagainst MUC-1, a vaccine was developed using a speciﬁc peptide to\nstimulate the patient’s own immune system against cancer cells. An\ninitial study suggested MUC-1 peptide therapy to be relatively safe\nin patients with pancreatic cancer; it also suggested that MUC-1\nhelps to enhance the immune response to tumor antigens (123). In\nanother initial clinical trial (124) that included patients with\nadvanced pancreatic cancer, MUC-1 showed antigen-speciﬁc T-\ncell responses in 5 of 8 patients (62.5%) who could be evaluated.\nNotably, patients who developed vaccine-speciﬁc T-cell responses\ndemonstrated signiﬁcantly improved OS (15.1 and 3.9 months,\nrespectively). These ﬁndings further elucidate the potential role of\nvaccine therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.\nNotably, a precise assessment of baseline antitumor-speciﬁc\nimmunity is critical to the prediction of clinical outcomes. In a\nphase I/II study (125) that included 48 patients with pancreatic\ncancer, outcomes were predicted based on baseline immunity; the\npatients received Wilms tumor 1 and/or MUC-1 peptide-loaded\nDC vaccination and standard chemotherapy. No serious adverse\nevents were observed in relation to vaccination, and the median PFS\nand OS were 8.1 and 15.1 months, respectively; in addition, the DC\nvaccine was found to have enhanced tumor-speciﬁc immunity.\nThese results suggest that DC-based immunotherapy combined\nwith conventional chemotherapy is safe and clinically beneﬁcial for\npatients with advanced PDAC. This may represent a promising new\nstrategy for the treatment of patients with recurrent or refractory\nPDAC with favorable prognostic factors.\n3.3 DC vaccines\nDCs play a key role in the immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer\n(126, 127). As professional antigen-presenting cells, DCs are\nessential for the T-cell response. They present extracellular\nantigens to CD4+ T cells via MHC class II molecules and\nintracellular antigens to CD8+ T cells via MHC class I molecules,\ndemonstrating the phenomenon of cross-presentation (128, 129).\nDC vaccines are developed by loading tumor-associated antigens in\nvitro (130) and then administering them to the patient to stimulate\nspeciﬁc immune responses against pancreatic cancer (127, 131).\nHowever, DC vaccines alone do not offer optimal efﬁcacy in the\ntreatment of pancreatic cancer due to the unique immunosuppressive\nmicroenvironment of pancreatic cancer (132). Nevertheless, relatively\nsatisfactory results have been achieved when combined with other\nmodalities such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy (133). Certain\nclinical trials have conﬁrmed the safety and efﬁcacy of DC vaccines in\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n08"}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "the treatment of pancreatic cancer (127). In this context, a clinical\nstudy (134) employed DC vaccines (alone or in combination with\nlymphokine-activated killer cells) along with gemcitabine and/or S1\nin patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer. The results showed that\nDC vaccine combined with chemotherapy showed certain safety and\nefﬁcacy for patients with advanced cancer refractory to standard\ntherapy. However, the results of 2 complete responses, 5 partial\nresponses, and 10 stable disease apply to a small proportion of the\npatients in the trial. In addition, the median survival was 360 days,\nbut it should be noted that this is only a statistical measure and does\nnot represent the prognosis of all patients. Therefore, further studies\nare needed to verify the reliability and applicability of these results.\nResearchers have also explored the possibility of combining\nDC-based immunotherapy with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid\nstabilized using polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (a Toll-like\nreceptor-3 agonist) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer (135).\nAutologous DCs derived from the peripheral blood of human\nleukocyte antigen-A2 patients were infused, and the agonist was\nadministered on the day of vaccination. The ﬁndings suggested that\nthe 12 participants showed good tolerance and the vaccine was\nsuccessfully generated. On imaging at day 56, 4 of the 8 patients had\nstable disease and progressive disease, respectively, with a median\nOS of 7.7 months. In addition, MHC-I tetramer analysis\ndemonstrated the successful formation of antigen-speciﬁc T cells\nin three patients with stable disease. This study provides a glimmer\nof hope for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nThese vaccines can overcome the immunosuppressive tumor\nmicroenvironment of pancreatic cancer, activate a variety of\nimmune cells, break the immune tolerance state, enable the\nimmune system to recognize and attack pancreatic cancer cells,\npromote the immune system to form long-term immune memory,\nand improve the long-term immune protection effect. In addition,\nthe antigens provided by the vaccine can be effectively recognized\nand processed by the immune system, which further enhances the\nability of the immune system to recognize and attack tumors.\nHowever, due to the unique immunosuppressive\nmicroenvironment of pancreatic cancer, it is difﬁcult to use these\ntumor vaccines alone to achieve ideal effects. Therefore, the\ncommonly used combination immunotherapy could improve the\ntherapeutic effect in clinical practice, such as whole-cell vaccine\ncombined with chemotherapy drugs such as gemcitabine, or\ncombined with nivolumab. Peptide vaccine combined with\nchemotherapy drugs; dendritic vaccines combined with\nlymphokine-activated killer cells, gemcitabine and/or S-1, and\nDCs immunotherapy combined with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3\nagonists, etc. In order to fully exert the potential efﬁcacy of tumor\nvaccines, it is necessary to design a multi-antigen combination\nvaccine that covers a variety of tumor-speciﬁc antigens and\nimproves the broad spectrum of the vaccine. At the same time, it\nis necessary to take the unique characteristics of the\nimmunosuppressive microenvironment of pancreatic cancer\npatients into account to enhance the adaptability of vaccines to\nthis environment and adopt individualized strategies to consider the\ndifferences between different individuals. This comprehensive\ndesign is expected to provide a more effective immunotherapy for\npancreatic cancer treatment.\nOverall, the tumor vaccine trials enrolled small samples; larger\nsample sizes are needed to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the vaccines in\ndetail (136). In this context, patients with pancreatic cancer\ndemonstrate a small number of effector T and NK cells in the\nperipheral blood; in addition, the TME inhibits the activity of\neffector T cells, thereby reducing the efﬁcacy of the tumor\nvaccines (132, 137). New mechanisms of action need to be\nexplored in order to fully exploit the potential efﬁcacy of tumor\nvaccines, and multi-antigen combination vaccines (138) covering a\nwide variety of tumor-speciﬁc antigens need to be designed to\nbroaden the spectrum of the vaccine. It is also necessary to consider\nthe unique characteristics of the immunosuppressive\nmicroenvironment of pancreatic cancer, enhance vaccine\nadaptability to this environment, and adopt individualized\nstrategies (139) based on individual differences. Vaccine designs\nbased on this comprehensive approach may provide a more effective\nimmunotherapy strategy for pancreatic cancer.\n4 Other immune-related therapies\nAs a prominent research direction in the ﬁeld of pancreatic\ncancer treatment, immunotherapeutic approaches have included\nvarious innovative strategies (140, 141). Among these, ACT (142),\noncolytic virus therapy (143), and matrix depletion therapy (144)\nhave shown signiﬁcant therapeutic potential. Although they\nenhance functioning of the immune system to combat pancreatic\ncancer via different mechanisms, each therapeutic strategy has its\nown unique advantages and disadvantages (Figure 3). ACT offers\nthe advantages of individualized treatment and durable antitumor\neffects, but is associated with the disadvantages of complex\npreparation methods and high costs (145, 146). Oncolytic viruses\n(OVs) offer the advantage of selectively infecting cancer cells and\ninducing immune responses; however, the process of selective\ninfection needs to be improved and the replication ability is\nlimited (147). The advantage of matrix depletion therapy lies in\nits ability to act on the unique TME of pancreatic cancer; it thereby\nenhances the effect of other treatments. However, it is associated\nwith the disadvantages of an unstable effect and a long course of\ntreatment. In summary, although these therapies bring new hope\nand offer more possibilities for the treatment of pancreatic cancer,\nfurther improvement and research are needed (148, 149). The\nsubsequent sections provide a detailed description of the\napplication of three immunotherapy modalities in the treatment\nof pancreatic cancer.\n4.1 ACT\nACT involves the expansion and/or reactivation of autologous\nor allogeneic immune effector cells in vitro to increase\nimmunogenicity and immunoreactivity. Rapid developments in\nthe ﬁeld of antigen identiﬁcation, gene therapy, and T cell biology\nhave led to the emergence of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)\ncell therapy and T cell receptor-engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapy\n(150, 151). Notably, the processes involved in the use of TCR-T and\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n09"}, {"page_number": 10, "text": "CAR-T for the treatment of pancreatic cancer differ slightly (152).\nIn TCR-T, the T cells are ﬁrst collected from patients; they are then\nselected and the TCR sequence is genetically modiﬁed to speciﬁcally\nbind to pancreatic cancer cells. The genetically modiﬁed T cells are\nthen reinfused to the patient, and they attack the antigen-expressing\ntumor cells. In contrast, CAR-T therapy involves the introduction\nof a CAR into the patient’s T cells to ensure that they directly\nrecognize and bind to pancreatic cancer cells. The genetically\nmodiﬁed CAR-T cells are then reinfused, and they seek and\ndestroy cancer cells that express the antigen recognized by the\nCAR (153, 154). Both therapies provide individualized treatment\noptions for patients with pancreatic cancer by speciﬁcally attacking\ncancer cells via immune system activation.\nA new immunotherapy modality used in a recently published\nreport has gained widespread attention. This therapeutic approach\nhas attracted considerable interest as it involves KRAS mutations\n(155), which are found in approximately 90% of patients with\npancreatic cancer. The most common subtype, namely, KRAS\nG12D, is found in 41% of patients (156, 157). In the study (158),\na patient with progressive metastatic pancreatic cancer received a\nsingle dose of genetically engineered therapy with autologous T cells\nwhich carried two allogeneic human leukocyte antigen-C*08:02-\nrestricted TCRs directed against KRAS G12D mutations; the\ninfusion dose was 16.2 × 109 cells. Clinical evaluation at 1 month\nafter treatment showed a reduction in the volume of visceral\nmetastasis by 62%. Over the next 6 months, the volume of\nvisceral metastases continued to shrink by up to 72%, and this\nvolume remained stable 6 months later. The ﬁndings of this study\noffer new hope for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.\nHowever, a second patient with the same KRAS mutation and\nhuman leukocyte antigen allele did not beneﬁt from TCR-T cell\ntherapy. Although the reason for the lack of beneﬁt remains unclear,\ntreatment-related toxicities are a concern with TCR-T therapy (150,\n152). Its efﬁcacy and the TME requirements warrant further\nevaluation. Despite the limitations, the case report highlights the\npotential efﬁcacy of TCR gene therapy in targeting the KRAS G12D\nhot-spot mutation and inducing regression of metastatic pancreatic\ncancer, and therefore provides an important basis for future studies.\nIn this context, TCR-T cell immunotherapy has offered remarkable\nresults in the treatment of certain solid tumors [especially in liver\ncancer (159), melanoma (160), and synovial cell sarcoma (161)],\nwhere clinical data have shown strong anticancer activity.\nFor CAR-T therapy, the known potential antigen targets include\nmesothelin (162), claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2) (163), chemokine\nreceptor 6 (CXCR6) (164), prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)\n(165), carcinoembryonic antigen, and human epidermal growth\nfactor receptor 2, among others. However, the clinical use of T-cell\nproducts targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and\ncarcinoembryonic antigen has been associated with serious adverse\nevents (166, 167). This limits the use of these antigens as targets for\nCAR-T therapy in PDAC. Conversely, autologous mesothelin-\nspeciﬁc CAR-T cells modiﬁed using slow virus transduction have\nbeen demonstrated to be safe and have shown potential anti-tumor\nactivity (168). In a phase III clinical trial (169) on patients with\nadvanced pancreatic cancer that expressed glypican-1 or\nmesothelin, anti-mesothelin-7*19 CAR-T therapy resulted in near\ncomplete tumor eradication at 240 days after intravenous infusion.\nThese results further suggest that the introduction of 7*19 into\nCAR-T cells may signiﬁcantly enhance the antitumor activity\nagainst pancreatic cancer. A subtype of tight junction protein\nCLDN18, namely, CLDN18.2, is another potential target for\nCAR-T therapy. Under normal conditions, it is mainly expressed\nby differentiated epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa, and is\nexpressed in up to 70% cases of gastric adenocarcinoma (170).\nHowever, CLDN18.2 activation has also been observed in\npancreatic (171), esophageal (172), ovarian (173), and lung\ncancers (174), among others. In the most recent study (163), two\npatients with metastatic pancreatic cancer were treated with\nCLDN18.2 CAR-T after failure of standard therapy. The\nperipheral blood counts of CD8+T and regulatory T cells had\nincreased after treatment, while those of CD4+T and B cells had\ndecreased. This suggested that CAR-T therapy (targeting\nCLDN18.2) achieved complete remission of lung metastases and\ngood tumor control. It further suggested that CLDN18.2 may\nrepresent a promising CAR-T target in the treatment of\npancreatic cancer. In addition, CAR-T cells targeting pancreatic\ncancer can enhance their invasion, adhesion and therapeutic effect\nby overexpressing CXCR6. One study showed that engineering T\ncells to highly express CXCR6 made these T cells attracted to the\nCXC chemokine ligand 16 released by pancreatic cancer cells,\nresulting in enhanced T cell recognition and clearance of\npancreatic cancer cells (175). This study was validated in multiple\nanimal models, showing that CXCR6-engineered T cells were\neffective in tumor recognition and elimination and signiﬁcantly\nprolonged the survival of the mice. The results of this study\nsuggested that T cells armed with tumor-speciﬁc chemokine\nreceptors may be an effective strategy for the treatment of\npancreatic cancer and deserve further in-depth investigation.\nThe levels of PSCA expression have also been found to be\nsigniﬁcantly increased in primary PDAC compared to those in\nnormal or adjacent tissues. In their study, Teng et al. (165)evaluated\na novel immunotherapy modality based on human NK cells. The\nstudy evaluated the safety and efﬁcacy of PSCA CAR NK cells that\nco-expressed soluble interleukin-15, with the goal of improving\ntherapeutic efﬁcacy. The treatment demonstrated signiﬁcant tumor\ninhibitory effect on PSCA(+) pancreatic cancer cells in vitro before\nand after one freeze-thaw cycle. In addition to signiﬁcant efﬁcacy in\nthe human metastatic pancreatic cancer model, the treatment\ndemonstrated no toxic side effects. This provides a strong\ntheoretical basis for the development of CAR-NK-based immune\ncell therapy for pancreatic cancer and lays the foundation for future\nclinical application.\nDespite the favorable results, both TCR-T and CAR-T therapies\nare associated with a series of challenges. TCR-T therapy is\nassociated with issues related to selection of the appropriate TCR\ntarget, afﬁnity, and optimization, and requires the infusion of a large\nnumber of cells. CAR-T therapies are often subject to “on-target,\nout-of-tumor” effects, as tumor-associated antigens are present in\nnormal tissues. In order to resolve this issue, messenger ribonucleic\nacid engineering methods have been used to improve CAR-T\nspeciﬁcity (176); however, the issue pertaining to selection of\ntherapeutic targets has not yet been addressed. Future research\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n10"}, {"page_number": 11, "text": "needs to address the limitations of these therapies and ﬁnd safer and\nmore effective therapeutic targets.\n4.2 Oncolytic virotherapy\nOVs are a class of viruses that are capable of selectively infecting\nand killing tumor cells without damaging normal cells (177); these\ninclude both natural and genetically engineered strains. Upon reaching\nthe tumor site, OVs do not infect or replicate in normal cells but\nspeciﬁcally infect tumor cells (178). They lyse the tumor cells and\nrelease progeny viruses that infect the surrounding tumor cells (179). In\naddition, the expression of viral antigens induces an antiviral immune\nresponse (180), which further helps destroy tumor cells. OV therapy\nconfers the advantages of high speciﬁcity, low toxicity, and low drug\nresistance for the treatment of malignant tumors, especially pancreatic\ncancer. This treatment triggers an inﬂammatory cascade that\nsimultaneously stimulates an adaptive immune response. In this\ncontext, an OVs based on modiﬁed herpes simplex virus type I,\nnamely, talimogene laherparepvec (181) has been approved by the\nFDA for the treatment of melanoma. This has triggered further\nresearch on the use of OVs for the treatment of malignant tumors.\nThe OVs currently used for the treatment of pancreatic cancer mainly\ninclude adenoviruses, reoviruses, and herpes simplex viruses, among\nothers. These have been discussed in detail in the subsequent sections.\nAdenoviruses can be engineered to carry speciﬁc genes (182)\nthat may help inhibit tumor growth, induce apoptosis, or enhance\nthe response of the immune system. Although meso-CAR-T has\nshown some efﬁcacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, it has\nlimited anti-tumor effect. In order to improve its efﬁcacy, Watanabe\net al. (183) combined meso-CAR-T cells with an oncolytic\nadenovirus that expressed tumor necrosis factor-a and\ninterleukin-2. This signiﬁcantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of\nmeso-CAR-T cells in human-PDAC-xenograft immunodeﬁcient\nmice and syngeneic mouse tumor models. This enhancement was\nassociated with a marked increase in tumor-inﬁltrating\nlymphocytes and improved T-cell function. The ﬁndings suggest\nthat the enhancement of CAR-T cell therapy efﬁcacy (in PDAC)\nusing cytokine-armed oncolytic adenoviruses represents a potential\nstrategy for overcoming the challenges associated with an\nimmunosuppressive TME.\nAs the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer is a\nparticular challenge, Lee et al. (184) performed a preliminary study\nto evaluate the use of endoscopic ultrasound-guided injection of an\nadenovirus-mediated double suicide gene (Ad5-yCD/mutTK(SR39)\nrep-ADP) in combination with chemotherapy. Among the 11\npatients who were enrolled in the study, 9 completed the\nassessment. One of them demonstrated a partial response at 12\nweeks, and 8 had stable disease. However, adenovirus\ndeoxyribonucleic acid was detected in the serum of 4 patients at 8\nweeks (median: 55 days). These ﬁndings suggest that the\ncombination of intratumoral replication-competent adenovirus-\nmediated double suicide gene therapy and gemcitabine is safe and\nwell tolerated in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.\nHowever, in-depth evaluation is needed in larger clinical trials to\nfurther conﬁrm its effect.\nPDAC is characterized by a dense connective tissue proliferative\nmatrix (185) which limits the delivery of anticancer drugs. In this\ncontext, the oncolytic adenovirus, VCN-01, has been designed to\nreplicate and express hyaluronidase in cancer cells with a\ndysfunctional RB1 pathway (186). Evaluation of its mechanism of\naction in preclinical models and patients with pancreatic cancer\nshowed that combination with chemotherapy signiﬁcantly\nimproved its antitumor effect. In addition, the serum levels of\nhyaluronidase had increased and tumor hardness had decreased,\nclearly indicating the destructive effect of the adenovirus on the\nmatrix. This provides a basis for the use of VCN-01 as a new\ntherapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer.\nReoviruses have demonstrated potential therapeutic effects in\npancreatic cancer via multiple mechanisms including oncolytic and\nimmune activation. In a phase II trial (187) which employed\nreoviruses with gemcitabine for treating patients with advanced\npancreatic cancer, the combination conferred a signiﬁcant survival\nadvantage. The median survival duration in the combination\ntherapy group reached 10.2 months, and survival rates of 45%\nand 24% were observed at 1 and 2 years, respectively. The efﬁcacy\nwas notably superior to that of monotherapy with gemcitabine, and\nwere consistent with the results obtained with the FOLFIRINOX\nregimen. Given the higher incidence of adverse events associated\nwith the FOLFIRINOX regimen, these ﬁndings suggest that\nreoviruses plus gemcitabine may offer a superior option for the\ntreatment of pancreatic cancer.\nHF10 is a spontaneously mutated OV derived from herpes\nsimplex virus-1 (188), that potentially exhibits potent effects against\nmalignant tumors without damaging normal tissues. In a study\n(189) that included patients with unresectable advanced pancreatic\ncancer, substantial CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell inﬁltration was observed\nat 2 weeks after intratumoral injection of HF10; the ﬁndings\nsuggested that this therapy may have stimulated an antitumor\nimmune response. In another phase I clinical trial (190) from\nJapan, endoscopic ultrasound-guided intratumoral injection of\nHF10 combined with intravenous erlotinib and gemcitabine\ndemonstrated better therapeutic efﬁcacy than chemotherapy\ndrugs. These ﬁndings further suggest that HF10 could be a\npotential therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer, as it\nstimulates the immune response and improves therapeutic\nefﬁcacy. However, the deep-seated anatomical location of the\npancreas renders it difﬁcult to administer local injections. In\naddition, the dense stroma (191) in pancreatic cancer tissue\nhinders the dissemination of OVs between cancer cells. These\nfactors limit the implementation of strategies involving local\ninjections of OVs. Further research is therefore needed on the\nbiological behavior of pancreatic cancer. Future studies also need to\nfocus on the design of effective OV treatment regimens for\nthis disease.\nIn conclusion, although oncolytic virotherapy has shown some\npotential in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, we still need to\nbetter understand a series of safety issues that may be caused by\noncolytic virotherapy in clinical trials. These include the\ninﬂammatory response that can occur following viral infection,\nsuch as fever, fatigue and muscle pain. In addition, viral therapy\nmay also lead to adverse events related to viral replication, such as\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n11"}, {"page_number": 12, "text": "abnormal liver function and hematological abnormalities. In order\nto solve these problems, we need to closely monitor the vital signs\nand laboratory indicators of patients in clinical trials, and timely\ndetect and manage possible adverse reactions. It is worth noting that\nduring the treatment process, OV may have an impact on normal\ntissues, triggering potential off-target effects, such as non-speciﬁc\nimmune responses. Therefore, monitoring of virus spread closely\nduring treatment is needed to assess the safety and efﬁcacy\nof treatment.\n4.3 Matrix-depletion therapy\nThe stroma in pancreatic cancer tissue plays an important role\nin tumor development; it also forms a physical barrier that limits the\nefﬁcacy of treatment (192, 193). Matrix depletion therapy represents\na new strategy for overcoming this challenge in the treatment of\npancreatic cancer. The core goal of this therapy is to reduce the\nﬁbrous structure around the tumor and destroy the protective\nbarrier offered by the matrix (194); this improves permeability to\ndrugs and immune cells, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect.\nAs one of the main components of the extracellular matrix,\nhyaluronic acid may be associated with the occurrence and\ndevelopment of diseases and even drug resistance. A randomized\nphase II trial (195) evaluated a combination of pegvorhyaluronidase\nalfa (PEGPH20) and nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine versus nab-\npaclitaxel/gemcitabine alone in the treatment of metastatic\npancreatic cancer. The results showed that patients in the\ncombined group demonstrated higher PFS and objective response\nrates; in addition, the treatment effect was more obvious in patients\nwith high levels of hyaluronic acid. In their subsequent randomized\nphase III trial, Van Cutsem et al. (196) evaluated the efﬁcacy and\nsafety of combined PEGPH20 and nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine in\npatients with hyaluronic acid-high mPDAC. The results showed\nthat although the addition of PEGPH20 increased the objective\nresponse rate, it did not improve OS or PFS. Although the beneﬁts\noffered by the combination were in agreement with previous results,\nthey did not support the use of PEGPH20 in patients with mPDAC.\nFurther studies are required to evaluate its potential utility in\nthese cases.\nPancreatic stellate cells play a key role in the stroma of PDAC.\nOn activation by pro-ﬁbrotic mediators such as transforming\ngrowth factor-b, they secrete excessive amounts of extracellular\nmatrix proteins which produce a dense stroma (197). This in turn\nincreases tissue ﬂuid pressure and severely impedes diffusion of\ndrugs from the blood vessels to the tumor tissue. Han et al. (198)\ntherefore evaluated a two-step sequential dosing strategy for\ngemcitabine-based targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer. In their\nstrategy, they employed metformin to disrupt the dense matrix; this\nfacilitated the delivery of composite magnetic nanoparticles of\ngemcitabine and pH-low insertion peptide. The pH-low insertion\npeptide considerably enhanced the binding afﬁnity of the\nnanomedicine to PANC-1 cells. The results further showed\nsigniﬁcant inhibition of tumor growth, at a rate of 91.2% after 30\ndays of treatment. In addition to providing an effective strategy for\nimproving delivery efﬁciency of conventional drugs to the tumor\nsite, this study expands the application of metformin to the\ntreatment of stroma-rich malignancies.\nIn conclusion, stromal depletion therapy is expected to\novercome the challenges posed by the stromal barrier and\nenhance therapeutic effects in pancreatic cancer. However, this\nmodality is associated with multiple challenges including the\nphysiological burden, uncertainty of treatment responses, and\ntolerability. Although it represents a new concept for the\ntreatment of malignant tumors including pancreatic cancer,\nfurther studies are needed to make it suitable for clinical\napplication. In particular, studies need to comprehensively\nevaluate its advantages and disadvantages in order to improve\ntreatment safety and efﬁcacy.\n5 New immunotherapies\nThe ﬁeld of innovative immunotherapy has witnessed\nsigniﬁcant advancements in pancreatic cancer research, with the\nidentiﬁcation of various potential biomarkers. These biomarkers\nhave reﬁned the precision of diagnosis and treatment, enabled early\ndetection of the disease, facilitated the assessment of treatment\nresponses, and aided in predicting prognoses. Moreover, novel\ncombinations of immunotherapy, including the integration of\nendoscopy-mediated radiofrequency ablation with\nimmunotherapy and irreversible electroporation therapy, offer\nmore tailored and comprehensive treatment alternatives for\nindividuals suffering from pancreatic cancer. These developments\nare poised to revolutionize medical practices, offering more effective\nand hopeful treatment avenues for patients with pancreatic cancer.\n5.1 New potential biomarkers\nInvestigations into myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)\nhave highlighted their pivotal role in modulating immune\nresponses, potentially inﬂuencing the effectiveness of immune\ncells in combating cancer. Concurrently, abnormalities in arginine\nmetabolism have been associated with the immunotherapeutic\napproaches to pancreatic cancer, suggesting that further\ninvestigation could yield more effective treatment methodologies.\nMoreover, the role of leukemia inhibitory factor offers a novel\ninsight, where understanding its mechanism may facilitate the\ndevelopment of targeted immunotherapies. These emerging\nbiomarkers are pivotal in the realm of pancreatic cancer\nimmunotherapy, and their interactions with the disease is\nextensively elucidated.\nMDSCs are a heterogeneous group of bone marrow-derived\ncells, known for their immunosuppressive capabilities (199, 200).\nNormally, bone marrow cells differentiate into various immune\ncells, such as granulocytes, monocyte-macrophages, or dendritic\ncells. However, in the presence of inﬂammation, tumors, trauma, or\nother pathological states, this differentiation is halted, leading to the\nformation of MDSCs (201). These cells are categorized into two\nprimary types in both humans and mice, based on their lineage:\ngranulocytic/polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) and\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n12"}, {"page_number": 13, "text": "monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) (202). Characterized by their\ndampening effect on immune responses (203), MDSCs emerge as\ncrucial contributors to tumor immune evasion. As tumors progress,\nan increase in MDSCs signiﬁcantly inﬂuences tumor growth,\nmetastasis, and resistance to treatment. The mounting evidence\npositions MDSCs not merely as a hallmark of malignancy but also\nas a viable target in pancreatic cancer therapy (204).\nRecent studies have elucidated that exosomes released by tumor\ncells play a pivotal role in arresting and differentiating bone marrow\nhematopoietic stem cells. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor\n(MIF), a crucial component of tumor exosomes, emerges as a vital\nmolecule in the induction of MDSCs (205). Research has unveiled\nMIF’s capacity within pancreatic cancer exosomes to trigger the\ndifferentiation of monocytes into MDSCs. IPG1576, a potent small\nmolecule inhibitor targeting MIF tautomerase speciﬁcally, has been\nshown to thwart MDSC formation in the tumor microenvironment\neffectively, thereby enhancing CD8+ T cell activity and markedly\nreducing pancreatic cancer growth (206). This investigation posits\nMIF tautomerase inhibitors as promising agents in pancreatic\ncancer therapy, heralding a novel tactic for treating such tumors.\nThe potential of small molecule drugs, engineered through MIF\ntautomerase, shines a new light on future cancer treatments.\nFurthermore, the characteristic immunosuppression associated\nwith tumor progression can be countered by inhibiting or\ndepleting M-MDSCs, thus fostering antitumor immunity.\nResearchers found that a signiﬁcant correlation between the\npresence of chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and MDSCs in tumor\ntissues and the survival rates of pancreatic cancer patients has been\nobserved in surgical specimens (207). Utilizing a CCR2 blocker, PF-\n04136309, within an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer\ndemonstrated the ability to decelerate tumor growth and metastasis\nby diminishing MDSC inﬁltration in tumor tissues via the CCL2/\nCCR2 pathway (208). The CCL2/CCR2 chemokine axis is known to\nfacilitate the migration of M-MDSCs to tumor sites, cultivating an\nimmunosuppressive microenvironment. This pathway holds\nprognostic value in pancreatic cancer, where blocking CCR2 can\nrejuvenate anti-tumor immunity. These ﬁndings suggest a viable\ntherapeutic strategy in managing MDSC invasion through the\nCCL2/CCR2 pathway, offering an enhanced immunotherapy\napproach for pancreatic cancer patients.\nArginine, a conditionally non-essential amino acid, plays a\npivotal role in the metabolism of various malignant tumors,\nincluding pancreatic cancer (209). The metabolism alteration in\nthese cancers is primarily evidenced by the suppression of\nargininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), a crucial enzyme in arginine\nsynthesis (210). Consequently, treatments that deplete arginine\nlevels can markedly impair the proliferation, invasion, and\nmigration of pancreatic cancer cells, characterized by reduced\nASS1 activity (211). Arginine-deprivation therapies, such as ADI-\nPEG 20—a pegylated form of arginine deiminase—speciﬁcally\ntarget pancreatic cancer cells deﬁcient in ASS1. In an advanced\npancreatic cancer phase 1/1B single-arm clinical trial (212), a\nregimen combining ADI-PEG20, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel\ndemonstrated tolerability and efﬁcacy in both previously treated\nand untreated advanced pancreatic cancer patients, including those\nwith ASS1-deﬁcient tumors. The regimen involved administering\ngemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) for 3\nweeks, along with a weekly intramuscular injection of ADI-PEG 20\nat 36 mg/m2. The observed overall response rate was 45.5% (5 out of\n11 patients), with a median PFS of 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.3-11.2\nmonths). Treatment-related adverse effects included neutropenia,\nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and\nfatigue. These ﬁndings necessitate further investigation to establish\nASS1 expression as a predictive biomarker for arginine deprivation\ntherapy efﬁcacy. Nonetheless, arginine deprivation presents a\npromising therapeutic approach for future treatment modalities\nin pancreatic cancer patients.\nLeukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the interleukin-6\ncytokine family, mediates signal transduction between pancreatic\ncancer cells and stellate cells, emerging as a pivotal factor in the\nregulation of cell differentiation, renewal, and survival. Its role in\nsupporting cancer progression positions LIF as a potential\ntherapeutic target for pancreatic cancer (213). Research by Shi\net al. (214)has shown that both the pharmacological inhibition of\nLIF and the genetic deletion of LIF markedly delay tumor\nprogression and augment chemotherapy effectiveness by altering\ncancer cell differentiation and the epithelial-mesenchymal\ntransition status, consequently extending survival in a mouse\nmodel of PDAC. Additionally, aberrant LIF production in the\npancreas is observed exclusively under pathological conditions in\nboth mouse models and human PDAC, linking it to the disease’s\npathogenesis. Collectively, these ﬁndings underscore LIF’s critical\nrole in PDAC development and its potential as a therapeutic target\nand biomarker, meriting further clinical exploration.\nIn recent years, the imbalance of intestinal ﬂora has become an\nimportant link in the occurrence and development of pancreatic\ncancer (215). Intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites play\nan important role in chemotherapy and immunotherapy of\npancreatic cancer. One study found that indole-3-acetic acid, a\ntryptophan metabolite produced by two gut bacteria (bacteroides\nfragilis, bacteroides polymorpha), was found to be at better levels in\nchemotherapeutic PDAC patients, and chemotherapy efﬁcacy could\nbe enhanced by direct indole-3-acetic acid supplementation or by\nperforming a high-tryptophan diet (216). This provides the impetus\nto consider nutritional interventions during the treatment of cancer\npatients. In addition, the intratumoral and gut microbiota can have\nsigniﬁcant effects on innate and adaptive immunity, and therefore\ncan also determine cancer progression and response to therapy in\npart. Gut microbiota-derived trimethylamine N-oxide has been\nshown to have immunomodulatory effects and thus may be a\ntherapeutic entry point to enhance anti-tumor immune responses,\nthus enabling PDAC to respond to checkpoint immunotherapy\n(217). This study lays a foundation for potential therapeutic\nstrategies targeting trimethylamine N-oxide and provides a new\nidea for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nIn summary, investigating these biomarkers’ interplay offers\ndeeper insights into the patient’s immune system status, enabling\nmore precise, personalized treatment plans and advancing the\napplication of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer treatment.\nSuch research illuminates new avenues for future clinical practice\nand innovative strategies to navigate the complexities of pancreatic\ncancer therapy.\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n13"}, {"page_number": 14, "text": "5.2 New potential\nimmunotherapeutic combinations\nRecently, there have seen considerable innovation in pancreatic\ncancer immunotherapy, introducing numerous promising\ntherapeutic combinations. These include endoscopy-mediated\nradiofrequency ablation (RFA), immunotherapy, and irreversible\nelectroporation therapy, as well as the integration of selective\nmultikinase inhibitors and immunotherapy. Such combinations\nunveil new avenues for clinical application. RFA offers a\nminimally invasive method to eliminate cancer lesions, setting the\nstage for further treatments (218). Immunotherapy, on the other\nhand, stimulates the immune system, intensifying its response to\npancreatic cancer cells. Irreversible electroporation therapy\nenhances treatment efﬁcacy via the electric ﬁeld effect (219),\nwhereas the synergy of selective multikinase inhibitors with\nimmunotherapy transforms the tumor microenvironment,\nincreasing the susceptibility of pancreatic cancer to treatment\n(220). The detailed application of these three combination\ntherapies in the clinical management of pancreatic cancer will be\nelaborated upon below.\nRFA has gained recognition as an innovative approach for\ntreating locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC).\nA phase II study aimed to assess the safety of RFA in LAPC patients\n(221). The ﬁndings indicate that RFA constitutes a viable and safe\nsurgical intervention for LAPC when applied in strict adherence to\nestablished safety protocols. Further research involving endoscopic\nultrasonography-guided RFA of pancreatic neuroendocrine and\ncystic tumors has conﬁrmed its safety (222), reporting a\ncomplication rate of 10%. Enhancing surgical precautionary\nmeasures could mitigate the risk of complications. Additionally,\nthe integration of irreversible electroporation with immunotherapy\n(nivolumab) in a phase 1b trial for LAPC demonstrated tolerability\nwithout dose-limiting toxicities (223). A multicenter, phase 2\nadjuvant trial combining irreversible electroporation and\nnivolumab is currently underway for patients with LAPC,\nshowing potential therapeutic beneﬁts and warranting further\nexploration. Intriguingly, Falcomatà et al. (224)discovered that\nselective multikinase inhibitors rendered mesenchymal pancreatic\ncancer more amenable to immune checkpoint blockade by altering\nthe tumor microenvironment. A comprehensive drug screen of 418\ncompounds on human PDAC and mouse cancer cells revealed that\ntrametinib and nintedanib combination therapy inhibited the cell\ncycle, induced cancer cell death, and enhanced the tumor\nmicroenvironment for more effective T cell activity. The\ncombination of immunotherapy (anti-PD-L1 inhibitor) with\ntrametinib and nintedanib markedly improved treatment\nresponses in mice, with the triple therapy group achieving a\nsigniﬁcant survival beneﬁt over controls. This research paves the\nway for novel treatment strategies targeting the challenging and\nresistant stromal subtype of PDAC.\nIn summary, these multi-faceted combined treatment strategies\noffer comprehensive and personalized therapeutic options,\npresenting new hope and promising prospects for individuals\nwith pancreatic cancer. This approach establishes a robust\nfoundation for future clinical applications. However, it is\nimperative to closely monitor potential adverse reactions to\noptimize their application in patient care, ensuring these\ncombined treatments are administered with enhanced safety and\nefﬁcacy for pancreatic cancer patients.\n6 Conclusion and future perspectives\nPDAC is a highly heterogeneous malignant tumor with a high\npostoperative recurrence rate. As traditional treatment methods are\nlargely ineffective, patients with PDAC have a poor prognosis.\nAlthough traditional immunotherapy has been effective in\ntreating a wide variety of malignant tumors in recent years, the\ninherent genetic instability, local immunosuppressive\nmicroenvironment, and barrier effect of the dense matrix\nconsiderably impair its therapeutic effect in pancreatic cancer.\nEmerging tumor immunotherapy approaches provide new hope\nfor the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The development of ICIs is\nan important breakthrough in PDAC, and its antitumor effects have\nbeen demonstrated in patients. However, concerns pertaining to\ntheir toxicity and efﬁcacy largely limit widespread clinical\napplication. Cancer vaccines, ACT, OVs, and matrix modulators\nhave been demonstrated to offer potential beneﬁts in the treatment\nof pancreatic cancer, they are associated with a series of challenges.\nFor instance, further research is needed to address the issues of\ntumor heterogeneity and individual differences in relation to cancer\nvaccines, uncertainty of treatment effect with ACT, and the need to\npay attention to its toxicity. OVs demonstrate good tumor\nspeciﬁcity, their safety and efﬁcacy warrants further validation,\nand the issue of antibody neutralization needs to be resolved.\nMatrix modulators have improved the microenvironment of\nimmunosuppression in pancreatic cancer, the issues with\ntreatment complexity and tolerability need to be addressed. In\norder to address the limitations of immunotherapy for PDAC, it\nis essential that further studies aim at obtaining an in-depth\nunderstanding of the TME in pancreatic cancer, improving the\noff-target effects of ACT, summarizing the reasons for the failure of\nimmunotherapy drugs, and evaluating the feasibility of combined\ntreatment strategies.\nFuture research needs to explore more speciﬁc biomarker\nmolecules as well as immunotherapy combinations, and developing\nnew targeted drugs and cancer vaccines to better address the multiple\nimmune deﬁciencies in patients with PDAC. This may help improve\nthe safety and efﬁcacy of immunotherapy. Studies need to evaluate\nthe best immunotherapy combinations (Figure 3), patient selection\ncriteria, and the timing of treatment. Due to the suppressive effect of\nthe microenvironment of pancreatic cancer on immunity, single\nimmunotherapy is often difﬁcult to achieve ideal efﬁcacy (225).\nTherefore, the current research trend is to overcome the\nimmunosuppression in the microenvironment of pancreatic cancer\nand enhance the ability of immune cells to recognize and eliminate\ntumors by combining a variety of immunotherapy methods or\nZheng et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2024.1383978\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n14"}, {"page_number": 15, "text": "combining immunotherapy with other treatment methods (226), so\nas to improve the therapeutic effect.\nIn conclusion, it is essential to tailor treatment strategies based\non the patient condition to ensure optimal patient and tumor\noutcomes. Focusing on the use of individualized and combined\ntreatment strategies may effectively reduce adverse reactions and\nimprove comprehensive treatment of pancreatic cancer. Finally,\nimmunotherapy for pancreatic cancer is associated with both hopes\nand challenges. Continuous in-depth research and exploration is\nwarranted to improve patient outcomes.\nAuthor contributions\nRZ: Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing,\nConceptualization, Software.

The\nincidence of pancreatic cancer has also increased in the United States, and most of this\nincrease is attributed to the population’s aging process in addition to the rise in the preva-\nlence of risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, smoking, and alcohol intake. Most patients\nwith pancreatic cancer present with advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. Only\na few patients present at an early stage with localized disease, and a multidisciplinary\napproach is required to maximize survival and outcomes. The surgical approach is an\noption for localized disease, and surgery’s safety and efficacy have also been improved in\nrecent years due to the increasing use of minimally invasive surgical techniques. More-\nover, systematic chemotherapy has also been used and has had a significant impact on\nsurvival. More recently, neoadjuvant therapy has been used for pancreatic cancer along\nwith radiation therapy, optimizing survival among those patients. Targeted therapies have\nbeen introduced based on genetic testing in metastatic pancreatic cancer and have shown\npromising results. Moreover, immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted agents such as\nPARP inhibitors and vaccines have emerged with optimal results in terms of survival. To\nconclude, pancreatic cancer is considered a disease with poor long-term survival; however,\nrecent developments in pharmacotherapy have changed its treatment and have improved\noutcomes with improved survival. Our review summarizes ongoing therapeutic options\nfor local and metastatic pancreatic cancer. It also summarizes new state-of-the-art thera-\npies that have emerged or are in trials, which can change the pancreatic cancer treatment\nperspective.\nKeywords: pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC); neoadjuvant therapy; target therapy;\nimmunotherapy; CAR-T\n1. Introduction\nPancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death\nin developed countries, including Europe and the United States [1,2]. Approximately\n495,773 cases of pancreatic cancer were diagnosed worldwide in 2020 [2]. Furthermore,\nJ. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1129\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14041129"}, {"page_number": 2, "text": "J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1129\n2 of 15\n66,440 new pancreatic cancer cases were diagnosed in 2024 in the US, with an estimated\n51,750 deaths, and these trends have been increasing in recent years [3]. Moreover, pan-\ncreatic cancer constitutes approximately 8.5% of all cancer-related deaths in the USA. The\noverall 5-year survival rate (2014–2020) is only 12.8%, and this poor prognosis is associated\nwith the aggressive local growth of this cancer and its early systemic spread [3]. Only\n10–15% of patients present with the early stage disease, while 25–30% present with regional\ndisease, and about 50–60% present with distant metastasis, contributing to the poor progno-\nsis associated with this disease [3]. PDAC presentation in the advanced stage is attributable\nto the anatomical location of the pancreas, with cancer involving the superior mesenteric\nartery and veins early in the disease course, limiting the efficacy of currently available\ntreatment options. Additionally, the molecular heterogeneity of cancer results in varying\nand suboptimal clinical responses to the best available conventional chemotherapy [4]. The\ntreatment and prognosis of the PDAC also depend on the resectability of the tumor at the\ntime of the presentation, as well as surgical expertise, as incomplete resection results in poor\nsurvival and quality of life [5]. These factors have led to the recent trend of neoadjuvant\napproaches for pancreatic cancer treatment [5].\nAlthough PDAC is still a poorly understood disease, recent developments in the\nsurgical field have improved survival rates for localized pancreatic disease. Similarly,\nsystematic therapy has evolved with the growing interest in genomics and advancements\nin targeted therapies. [6] This review discusses the evidence behind current PDAC therapies\nand the novel treatment options in development to improve survival among these patients.\n2. Current Treatment Options\n2.1. Localized Pancreatic Cancer\nPancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the United\nStates, with most patients presenting with metastatic or unresectable disease [7]. About\n10–15% of patients present with localized disease; in these cases, multidisciplinary manage-\nment has proven necessary to optimize outcomes [8].\n2.1.1. Surgical Options\nThe NCCN guidelines classify localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)\naccording to resectability to help guide treatment decisions. Resectable PDAC is charac-\nterized by no significant contact with major arteries (celiac axis, SMA, or common hepatic\nartery) and minimal or no involvement of veins (SMV or PV), with ≤180◦contact without\nvein contour irregularity. Borderline resectable PDAC is defined by tumor contact of ≤180◦\nwith the SMV/PV but with sufficient healthy vessels for reconstruction. Locally advanced\nor unresectable PDAC involves > 180◦contact with the SMA or CA, involvement of the\naorta, or unreconstructible SMV/PV due to tumor invasion or occlusion [9].\nThe choice of surgery may differ depending on the location of the tumor. Tumors\nlocated distal to the pancreatic head are usually amenable to a distal pancreatectomy; how-\never, those located in the head and uncinate process require a pancreaticoduodenectomy\n(PD) for complete resection. PD was debuted in 1889 by the Italian Dr. Codivilla and\nwas later fully established by Dr. Whipple in 1935 through his two-step description [10].\nSurgical outcomes have improved in the last few decades with the availability of aggressive\nsurgical techniques, including vascular resection and reconstruction [11]. In 1994, Gag-\nner and Pomp reported the first laparoscopic PD (LPD) for treating chronic pancreatitis\nlocalized in the head of the pancreas in pancreas divisum [12]. Since then, the method\nhas gained popularity, with recent studies showing similar complication rates, overall\nsurvival, and 5-year survival rates between LPD and PD, as well as shorter lengths of\nhospitalization in patients undergoing LPD. Similarly, robotic PD (RPD) has primarily"}, {"page_number": 3, "text": "J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1129\n3 of 15\nobservational evidence to justify its use [13,14]. However, these surgical procedures have\nbeen significantly associated with short-term morbidity and mortality. Among the most\ncommon complications related to PD are pancreatic fistula (an average incidence of 5–15%)\nand delayed gastric emptying (20%). Surgical outcomes for PDAC have improved in the\npast decades due to the increased expertise in surgical techniques, including vascular\nresection and reconstruction [15]. This leads to a higher survival rate of 20–30%. However,\nthere are still higher recurrence rates associated with surgical treatments, likely due to the\npresence of micro-metastasis at the time of surgical intervention [14,16].\nThe NCCN and MD Anderson criteria for pancreatic cancer surgical resection are\nmainly similar, particularly in defining resectable tumors as those confined to the pancreas\nwithout central vascular involvement. However, they differ in some key areas. MD\nAnderson adopts a more lenient approach to vascular encasement, considering tumors\nwith short-segment involvement or limited arterial encasement resectable if reconstruction\nis feasible. In contrast, NCCN requires no vascular involvement or minimal contact\nwithout irregularity. Both guidelines categorize tumors with lymph node involvement\nor distant metastasis as unresectable. Notably, MD Anderson has a broader definition\nof borderline resectability, accepting cases with potential for organ resection or vascular\nreconstruction, which NCCN considers unresectable. Overall, MD Anderson offers a more\nflexible stance on resectability, particularly regarding vascular involvement and adjacent\norgan encroachment.\nTable 1 explains the surgical criteria for pancreatic cancer resection.\nTable 1.

Chemotherapy—Adjuvant\nEven in those diagnosed with a localized, resectable tumor, the prognosis remains\npoor, with only a 20% 5-year survival rate following surgery alone, with this rate increasing\nto 30–40% with adjuvant chemotherapy [17,18]. Several trials over the past two decades\nhave solidified the importance of adjuvant chemotherapy after the resection of PDAC,\nwith this combination offering the only hope for long-term survival or cure in patients\nwith nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer [18]. Based on the patient’s functional status, the\nrecommendation is either for modified FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan,\nleucovorin) for those with a high functional status or gemcitabine and capecitabine or gemc-\nitabine alone for those with a low functional status. The CONKO-001 trial showed modestly\nimproved median overall survival in patients treated with gemcitabine (22.8 months) com-\npared to those who underwent observation (20.2 months) in the 6 months following surgical\nresection. Adding erlotinib to gemcitabine did not improve outcomes in an adjuvant set-\nting [19]. The combination of adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin was evaluated in a phase\nII trial involving 22 patients that showed a median OS of 35.5 months. The combination\nwas feasible, although a high percentage of patients (59%) experienced grade ¾ toxicity [20].\nThe landmark ESPAC-1 trial also showed the benefit of adjuvant 5FU/leucovorin with\nimprovement in mOS from 14.0 months to 19.7 months [21]. The ESPAC-4 phase 3 trial\nshowed an added survival benefit in those who received dual-agent therapy (gemcitabine\nplus capecitabine) over gemcitabine alone. The above results demonstrated a consistent\npattern in adjuvant chemotherapy, a survival benefit of single-agent chemotherapy, and a\nfurther improvement in OS with the addition of capecitabine or cisplatin to gemcitabine.\nAnother combination available in adjuvant settings is gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel,\nwhich was evaluated in the APACT trial. The original analysis did not show a statistical\ndifference, but an updated analysis in 2021 showed a significant difference in median\noverall survival with a longer follow-up (41.8 vs. 37.7 mo, p = 0.0091) [22].\nIn 2018, the PRODIGE-24 trial, which included patients with excellent functional\nstatus, showed a significant improvement in favorable survival in patients who received\nmodified FOLFIRINOX (54.4 months) or gemcitabine alone (35 months) [23,24]. The higher-\nthan-average median survival in the control group was likely reflective of the superior"}, {"page_number": 5, "text": "J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1129\n5 of 15\nperformance status of the patient population in this trial compared to others. Thus, using\nFOLFIRINOX remains limited to patients with an ECOG performance status of 0–1.\n2.1.3. Chemotherapy—Neoadjuvant\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy has gained popularity over the last decade, owing to\nseveral trials showing its effectiveness in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC)\nand locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). When neoadjuvant chemotherapy is em-\nployed, patients should undergo restaging scans and then proceed to surgery if no disease\nprogression is noted. Since radiographic response in pancreatic cancer does not correlate\nwith pathological response, a lack of tumor shrinkage on imaging by itself should not\npreclude surgery in these patients. The NUPAT-01 trial showed encouraging outcomes with\nneoadjuvant therapy using either FOLFIRINOX or GemNabP in patients with borderline\nresectable pancreatic cancer with R0 resection rates of 67.4% and an mOS of 39.4 months.\nA multi-institutional trial by Jang et al. demonstrated improved margin-negative resec-\ntion rates in patients with BRPC receiving neoadjuvant therapy [25]. Another analysis\nfrom National Cancer Database showed that patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment\nfollowed by resection for stage I/II pancreatic cancer had better OS rates than propensity\nscore-matched patients who underwent upfront resection (mOS 26 months vs. 21 months,\nHR = 0.72, p < 0.01) [26]. Considering that a significant portion of patients cannot receive\nadjuvant systemic treatment due to operative morbidity, neoadjuvant therapy can increase\nthe number of patients eligible for systemic treatment by potentially eradicating occult\nmetastatic disease. However, its benefit in resectable PDAC continues to undergo investi-\ngation. A potential downfall of neoadjuvant therapy is the possibility of facilitating tumor\nprogression in the setting of inadequate tumor response [25]. Important trials evaluating\nthe benefit of neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer are listed below in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Several other studies also suggested\nimproved outcomes with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [28,29]. However, in the ALLIANCE\ntrial, which compared treatment with neoadjuvant-modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRI-\nNOX) with or without hypofractionated radiation therapy, the effectiveness of radiotherapy\ncould not be concluded, with no improvement in median overall survival noted [17,30].\nESPAC-1 trial also reported inferior outcomes with the addition of radiation to 5FU-based\nregimens in an adjuvant setting.\nThe LAP-07 trial evaluated the use of chemoradiation using capecitabine in patients\nwith unresectable pancreatic cancer who did not progress after 4 months of gemcitabine\nchemotherapy. Chemoradiation did not improve OS compared to continuing gemcitabine\nfor two more months. There was a small benefit in PFS with chemoradiation in this group,\nand thus, this approach can be considered if the patient desires to take a chemotherapy\nbreak.\nIn summary, the role of chemoradiation in locally advanced pancreatic cancer is not\nclear. It can be considered in the adjuvant setting after R1 resection and in the neoadjuvant\nsetting for select patients after a multidisciplinary review. In the neoadjuvant setting, data\nfrom small studies and retrospective analyses show improved rates of R0 resection with\nchemoradiation; further information from randomized clinical trials is needed. However,\nin the neoadjuvant setting, the use of radiation with FOLFIRINOX is not recommended\nowing to negative results from the SWOG study [31].\n2.1.5. Maintenance Therapy\nAbout 5–9% of patients with pancreatic cancer have germline or somatic mutations\nin the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Data indicate a response to PARP inhibition in this subset\nof platinum-sensitive patients. The phase 3 POLO trial evaluated the role of maintenance\nolaparib and showed improved median progression-free survival but no difference in\noverall survival in interim analysis. Olaparib gained approval in the USA in December\n2019 for patients with BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer and stable disease after first-\nline chemotherapy, becoming the first biomarker-based targeted therapy approved for\npancreatic cancer. This is an ongoing field of investigation, and the role of maintenance\ntherapy remains unclear [17,32].\n3. Unresected/Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer\nTreatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer necessitate a strategic approach.\nPatients face a competing risk between locoregional and systemic progression, both of\nwhich impact overall prognosis. Approximately one-third of these patients succumb to\nlocal progression without any metastasis. Systemic therapy, either alone or in combination\nwith locoregional treatment, has been utilized [33].\n3.1. Surgical Therapeutic Options\nThe palliative management of pancreatic cancer focuses on relieving biliary and\nduodenal obstructions and controlling pain. Endoscopic stenting is preferred over surgical\nbypass for biliary obstruction due to its minimally invasive nature and quicker recovery. A\nreview of 29 randomized trials confirmed stents as superior for palliation, with the choice\nof stent depending on prognosis: plastic stents (e.g., polyethylene) are preferred for patients\nwith a life expectancy under six months due to their lower cost, while metal stents (e.g.,\nWallstents) are chosen for those with longer prognoses because they carry a lower risk\nof recurrent bile duct obstruction [34]. For duodenal obstruction, endoscopic stenting is\nideal for patients with limited survival, whereas surgical gastrojejunostomy is considered\nfor those with better overall status or combined obstructions. Pain associated with PDAC"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1129\n7 of 15\ncan be managed with celiac plexus blocks or thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy, especially\nwhen conventional analgesics are insufficient. Endoscopic options are typically favored for\ntheir tolerability and effectiveness, but the choice of intervention should be guided by the\npatient’s prognosis and overall condition [31,34].\n3.2. Chemotherapy\nMultiagent chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for metastatic pancreatic\nductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\nSingle-agent chemotherapy has been studied for metastatic cancer treatment. In a\nphase II randomized trial, the effect of the FIRGEM regimen, which includes the infusion\nof irinotecan delivered before and after the 5-FU/Leucovorin (FOLFIRI.3) and fixed-dose\ngemcitabine monotherapy, was assessed. The median progression-free survival was 6\nmonths with FOLFIRI.3 and 3.4 months with gemcitabine (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38–0.90) [35].\nMoreover, rates of hematological toxicity were higher in the combination therapy cohort.\nMoreover, FOLFIRINOX, compared to gemcitabine, yielded a dramatic improvement in the\nmedian progression-free survival (PFS) (6.4 months vs. 3.3 months, p < 0.001) and median\noverall survival (11.1 months vs. 6.8 months, p < 0.001) [35,36].\nSeveral other combinations of gemcitabine have been explored, with some benefits\nobserved from combination therapy. For example, the MPACT trial showed improved\nsurvival at 42 months among patients who received gemcitabine plus albumin-bound\npaclitaxel. Similarly, gemcitabine with 5FU, erlotinib, cisplatin, and capecitabine has shown\nfew or no benefits for PDAC treatment [37–40].\nThe NAPOLI 3 trial began at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, this\nmultinational trial, conducted in 18 countries globally, marked a significant advancement\nin the treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with the introduction of nalirifox,\na newly favored regimen comprising liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and\noxaliplatin.\nA recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that nalirifox was more effective\nthan gemnabp as the initial treatment for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nThe overall survival reported among the patients who received nalirifox was 11.1 months,\ncompared to 9.2 months for those on gemnabp (HR = 0.83; p = 0.04). Moreover, there was\na small difference in the adverse effect profile of both drugs (322 out of 370, or 87% for\nnalirifox vs. 86% for gemnabp); however, the patterns of toxicity varied, as nalirifox was\nassociated with more gastrointestinal issues, whereas gemnabp had a higher incidence of\nhematologic toxicity. Treatment-related fatalities were recorded in six patients (2%) from\nthe nalirifox group and eight patients (2%) from the gemnabp group [41].\nNichetti et al., in a systematic review and meta-analysis, compared three primary treat-\nment regimens: nalirifox, folfirinox, and gemnabp. This highly anticipated review exam-\nined seven phase 3 clinical trials, encompassing 2581 patients (383 patients receiving naliri-\nfox, 433 patients receiving folfirinox, and 1756 patients receiving gemnabp). Progression-\nfree survival was found to be longer in patients treated with nalirifox (7.4 months [95%\nCI, 6.1–7.7]) and folfirinox (7.3 months [95% CI, 6.5–7.9]) than in those who received\ngemnabp (5.7 months [95% CI, 5.6–6.1]). Gemnabp yielded a shorter overall survival (OS)\nof 10.4 months (95% CI, 9.8–10.8) when compared to nalirifox (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.00–1.39];\np = 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference in overall survival between folfiri-\nnox (11.7 months [95% CI, 10.4–13.0]) and nalirifox (11.1 months [95% CI, 10.1–12.3]; HR,\n1.06 [95% CI, 0.81–1.39]; p = 0.65) [42].\nRecent studies have shown that among patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma from\na BRCA germline variant, the use of olaparib following initial platinum-based therapy\nenhances progression-free survival compared to the placebo (7.4 months vs. 3.8 months;"}, {"page_number": 8, "text": "J.

Only 1–2% of pancreatic\ncancers are MSI-H or dMMR, for which pembrolizumab is a valid option as a second line\nand beyond.\n4. Pancreatic Cancer Emergent Therapies\nTarget Therapy, Immunotherapy, and CAR-T\nThe current landscape of pancreatic therapies is ever-changing, and future/emerging\ntherapies have gained momentum over the past several years. Below is a brief discussion\nregarding the above therapies and the overall future of pancreatic cancer therapy.\nRecent years have seen the approval of many targeted cancer therapies that can be\nused in any metastatic cancer with certain mutations for which first-line therapies have been\nexhausted. These include larotrectinib, entrectinib, and repotrectinib for NTRK-mutated\ncancers; pembrolizumab for high microsatellite instability (MSI-high), mismatch repair\ngene-deficient (dMMR), or high-tumor-mutation-burden (TMB) cancers; dabrafenib and\ntrametinib for cancers with BRAF V600E mutation; selpercatinib for cancers with RET gene\nfusions; and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan for cancers with an overexpression of HER2\noncoprotein. However, only 1–2% of pancreatic cancers exhibit MSI-high/dMMR, and the\npresence of other mutations discussed above is also very low.\nTargeted therapy classically involves using identified germline or somatic mutations\nwithin cancer cells and creating a medication specifically targeting the affected pathway.\nOne of the most mutated genes in pancreatic cancer is KRAS (involving the G12 codon).\nUnfortunately, the KRAS gene has been difficult to target. Sotorasib is an FDA-approved\ndrug that targets the G12C codon and accounts for a small portion of the mutated gene.\nCurrently, clinical trials are investigating the combination of sotorasib with other thera-\npies [44]. Adagrasib is another targeted therapy for the G12C codon pathway currently\nbeing investigated. It has demonstrated encouraging results and is reportedly well toler-\nated [45]. Additional KRAS G12C targets are undergoing clinical trial investigation with\nminimal preliminary data [45].\nWhile the above therapies appear to have some utility, G12C exhibits low expression\nin pancreatic cancers. G12D is the most frequently mutated subtype allele involving the\nKRAS pathway in pancreatic cancer. Two medications are currently being investigated.\nMRTX1133 is a G12D inhibitor undergoing phase I/II clinical trial testing. RMC-9805\nis another G12D inhibitor in phase I evaluation. Target therapy for KRAS is primarily\ndifficult due to the allelic distribution in the mutations. This has led the medical community\nto research inhibitors for multiple KRAS mutant alleles, known as pan-RAS inhibition.\nRMC-6236 is currently under clinical investigation in a phase I trial [46].\nThe above medications require further trials related to specific allele mutations with\nKRAS and demonstrate the need to target upstream and downstream pathways that affect\nKRAS mutations. Upstream targets such as SHP2 and SOS1 are involved in KRAS signaling\nactivation. These targets use nucleotide exchange to help the KRAS pathway cycle between\ninactive and active states. SHP2 and SOS1 inhibitors are being developed and undergoing\nearly phase clinical trials [3]. Downstream targeting involves specific KRAS pathways,\nsuch as RAF-MEK-ERK and P13K-AKT-mTOR [46,47].\nIn addition to KRAS signaling pathways, other pathways, such as tyrosine kinase\nsignaling, have offered benefits in other cancer therapies. This pathway is actively being"}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1129\n9 of 15\nstudied in pancreatic cancer as a beneficial avenue for cancer therapy. The EGFR inhibitor\nerlotinib has previously been used for metastatic pancreatic patients, with evidence demon-\nstrating prolonged survival. Other EGFR inhibitors, such as nimotuzumab (humanized\nantibody), are currently being studied. Different strategies have been used to employ\nfocal adhesion kinases, which are non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors that delay tumor\ngrowth. Current studies are testing FAK inhibitors with chemotherapy to monitor the\ndegree of anti-tumor response. Finally, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors are also being\nevaluated in clinical trials with chemotherapy, such as the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and\npembrolizumab [46,47].\nAdditional therapies target gene fusions in known RET, NRG1, and NTRK alterations.\nSelpercatinib, pralsetinib, and other next-generation inhibitors are currently undergoing\nclinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of using RET inhibitors. Zenocutuzumab and seriban-\ntumab are NRG1 inhibitors (affecting the downstream MAPK and P13K pathways) and are\nalso undergoing clinical trial investigation [44,47].\nMoreover, the MTAP/PRMT/CDKN2A is another novel pathway which is generating\ninterest. This pathway involves the MTAP gene, specifically the deletion of the PRMT5 gene\n(involved in DNA methylation) on chromosome 9p21 found in some pancreatic cancers in\nMTAP-deficient cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of CDKN2A (a cyclin-dependent kinase\nthat interacts with PRMT5) is also being investigated, and solid tumors have demonstrated\na loss of MTAP and CDK2A genes in some PDAC patients [46].\nIn the past 5 years, PARP inhibitors have been investigated further for BRCA 1/2\nmutations. PARP inhibitors are often used in maintenance therapy as nonchemother-\napy treatment options. A phase III clinical trial for olaparib showed an improvement in\nprogression-free survival, which later led to its approval by the FDA. Rucaparib is an-\nother maintenance therapy that targets PALB2-mutated pancreatic cancer and has shown\nbeneficial results for progression-free survival in clinical trials. The NCCN recommends\nrucaparib for use in metastatic pancreatic cancer with germline mutations in BRCA1/2\nor PALB2. PARP inhibitors continue to gain interest from the scientific community, and\nseveral clinical trials are underway [44]. Table 3 lists all the trials evaluating new strategies\nfor pancreatic cancer management.\nImmunotherapy has had debatable success in pancreatic cancer treatment. For in-\nstance, the evaluation of CD40 agonists has sparked some interest in studies investigating\nthe response to pancreatic cancer when combined with/without chemotherapy. Further-\nmore, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has also been scrutinized, with minimal\nevidence demonstrating efficacy in treating pancreatic cancer. Several clinical trials are\nunderway to explore CAR-T’s role further [45–48] (Table 3).\nA flow chart of the manuscript, including all the available therapeutic options, is\nshown in Figure 1.\nTable 3.

Discussion\nIn this review article, we have reviewed the current and ongoing therapeutic options\nfor PDAC. The disease presentation determines the treatment option. Among the different\nsurgical options, laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD) and open pancreatoduo-\ndenectomy (OPD) have been well-studied [39]. Two meta-analyses compared the LDP\nand OPD in terms of postoperative outcomes in 9144 and 15,278 patients with pancreatic\ncancer [49,50]. The reported rates of pancreatic fistulas and rates of mortality were similar\nbetween the two groups; however, R0 resections, harvested lymph nodes, overall survival\nrates, and 5-year survival rates were better in the LPD group than in the OPD group [49,50].\nOther surgical options include the robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) and the mini-\nmally invasive PD, and studies have shown no differences in the outcomes of both surgical\nmethods [51]. Most patients present with disease recurrence due to metastasis, the liver be-\ning the most common organ for metastasis [52–55]. To minimize the risk of recurrence due\nto metastasis for those with local resectable disease undergoing surgical resection, neoadju-\nvant therapy has shown significant benefits in terms of survival, representing a substantial\nadvancement in the treatment of PDAC. Surgical resection often requires extension into the\nvascular structure for successful R0 (complete resection) tumor resection. However, patients\nwith locally advanced and metastatic disease on presentation should be treated with the\ndefinitive chemotherapy, which includes folfirinox, gemnabp, or gemcitabine + capecitabin\nwith or without radiation. If the patient is responsive to initial chemotherapy, surgical\nresection can be considered for residual tumor removal. Pancreatic cancer with distal\nmetastasis into different organs generally should not undergo resection [52–55]. However,\ncertain advanced surgical centers around the world have attempted the surgical resection\nof PDAC for metastatic disease. Hackert et al. published a series on the resection of PDAC,\nin which they resected both liver and aortocaval lymph node metastasis in 128 patients.\nThey reported a median survival of 12.5 months after resection. The overall 5-year survival\nwas 5.9% and 7.0% after liver and nodal resection, respectively [56]. Wang et al. compared\nhepatic artery chemotherapy infusion therapy with adjuvant systematic chemotherapy\namong two groups of patients with PDAC metastasis in the liver and found that the 5-year\ndisease-free probability was the same between the two groups; however, hepatic artery\ninfusion group had better 5-year overall survival probability and hepatic metastasis-free\nsurvival [57]. With more data linked to identifying the role of genetic mutations, the future\nof pancreatic cancer therapy appears to relate to germline and somatic sequencing and ex-\nploiting targetable genetic mutations. Some target therapies are used against macrophages\nin the environment to help promote an anti-T-cell response to kill the target cancer cells.\nAdditionally, there have been advances in immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrating efficacy in treating advanced and metastatic\ndisease. Other avenues of therapy research have investigated the utility of stimulating\ndendritic cells and creating an adaptive immune response using cancer vaccines.\nThe gut microbiota is known to actively participate in the various physiological pro-\ncesses of the human body for survival and function. Recent murine model studies have\nshown that altering the gut microbiome may influence the development and progression of\ndifferent cancers, immune responses, and treatment outcomes. New methods, including\nprobiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, dietary modifications, and antibi-\notics, may influence the gut microbiome by regulating the gut microbiota composition. This\naltered microbiome can significantly affect tumor progression, reshape the tumor environ-\nment, and enhance treatment outcomes. Further research is necessary to understand the\nparticular manipulations in the gut microbiome and develop personalized PDAC therapies\nto treat this disease [58]."}, {"page_number": 12, "text": "J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1129\n12 of 15\nThere are some limitations of our study. First, it is only a comprehensive review of\nthe available trials on PDAC therapy, and there is a chance of missing the discussion of\nnovel ongoing therapy trials, as there is a significant focus on research on this topic. Second,\nsome personalized therapies which have shown equivocal results in the progression and\ntreatment of PDAC have not been discussed in this review. Third, the eligibility criteria for\neach trial are not discussed in this review, so the generalizability of the chemotherapeutic\noptions cannot be stratified to the common patient population. Lastly, the toxicity of the\nindividual therapies has not been discussed in this study.\n6. Conclusions\nIn summary, pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with grim survival outcomes.\nAdvanced disease with metastasis at the time of presentation leaves few therapeutic choices.\nSpecific new treatment options have become available with modest overall benefits.

The \npredominant approach to managing pancreatic cancer patients continues to be systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. Despite \nsubstantial advancements in immunotherapy strategies for various cancers, their clinical utility in pancreatic cancer has \nproven less effective and durable. Whether administered as monotherapy, employing immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor \nvaccines, chimeric antigen receptors T cells, or in combination with conventional chemoradiotherapy, the clinical outcomes \nremain underwhelming. Extensive preclinical experiments and clinical trials in the realm of pancreatic cancer have provided \nvaluable insights into the complexities of immunotherapy. Chief among the hurdles are the immunosuppressive tumor micro-\nenvironment, limited immunogenicity, and the inherent heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer. In this comprehensive review, we \nprovide an overview and critical analysis of current clinical immunotherapy strategies for pancreatic cancer, emphasizing \ntheir endeavors to overcome immunotherapy resistance. Particular focus is placed on strategies aimed at reshaping the immu-\nnosuppressive microenvironment and enhancing T cell-mediated tumor cell killing. Ultimately, through deeper elucidation \nof the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of pancreatic cancer and the refinement of therapeutic approaches, we anticipate \nbreakthroughs that will pave the way for more effective treatments in this challenging disease.\nKeywords  Pancreatic cancer · Chemotherapy · Immunotherapy · Monotherapy · Combination therapy\nIntroduction\nPancreatic cancer, ranking as the seventh leading cause of \ncancer-related fatalities, remains a formidable malignancy \ncharacterized by a grim prognosis and a mortality-to-inci-\ndence ratio of 94% [1]. Although there has been a mod-\nest improvement in its 5-year survival rate in recent years, \na lack of breakthrough treatment options persists. Several \nfactors contribute to the dismal outlook for pancreatic cancer \npatients. Firstly, the absence of early diagnostic markers or \ndiscernible clinical symptoms suitable for pancreatic tumor \nscreening often results in the diagnosis of locally advanced \nor metastatic disease at the time of presentation. Secondly, \ntreatment options for pancreatic cancer are exceedingly lim-\nited, further compounding the poor prognosis.

Surgery represents the \nsole potential cure for this disease; however, a mere 20% \nof patients diagnosed with localized pancreatic cancer are \neligible candidates for surgical intervention. Furthermore, \nrecurrence of pancreatic cancer remains commonplace, \neven among patients who receive standard adjuvant therapy \nfollowing surgery [5]. Consequently, there exists an urgent \nimperative for novel therapeutic strategies in the battle \nagainst pancreatic cancer.\nImmunotherapy, in essence, entails the augmentation \nof the human immune system's capacity to recognize and \neliminate tumor cells through various mechanisms. Its over-\narching objective is the complete eradication of malignant \ncells while sparing normal cell function.

Nevertheless, its clinical utility in \nsolid tumors, notably pancreatic cancer, has been less aus-\npicious, though this does not preclude its promising potential \n[6].\nIn this comprehensive review, we provide an overview \nof current clinical immunotherapies for pancreatic cancer, \nelucidate their underlying mechanisms, and assess their \nefficacy. Furthermore, we spotlight technological advance-\nments, encompassing improvements in antibody technology, \nthe manipulation and amplification of cancer-killing cells, \nand cancer vaccines, all of which have injected innovation \ninto the field of immunotherapy and hold the promise of a \nbrighter future in the battle against pancreatic cancer.\nImmune checkpoint‑based treatment \noptions\nT cells represent indispensable components of the human \nimmune system, regulated by costimulatory and inhibi-\ntory signals as they engage in the recognition and elimi-\nnation of tumor cells in vivo [7, 8]. Immune checkpoints \nconstitute a category of immunosuppressive molecules that \noperate under physiological conditions to maintain self-\ntolerance and prevent the body from inadvertently harm-\ning its healthy cells during infection or excessive inflam-\nmation [9–11]. Research has revealed that tumor cells can \nelude immune cell recognition and destruction by binding to \nimmune checkpoints on the surface of immune cells, thereby \neffecting immune evasion [12–15]. Therapeutic strategies \ncentered on disrupting the interaction between tumor cells \nand immune cell checkpoints hold the potential to reverse \nimmune evasion. Notably, PD-1 (Programmed cell death \nprotein 1) and PD-L1 (Programmed death-ligand 1), as well \nas CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4), \nwere the first immune checkpoints to be discovered, garner-\ning significant attention as therapeutic targets [15] (Fig. 1). \nCorresponding monoclonal antibodies can prevent PD-1 \nfrom binding with PD-L1 and PD-L2, as well as inhibit the \nbinding of PD-L1 to CD80 protein, thereby reinstating the \nimmune system's ability, particularly that of T cells, to target \nand eliminate tumor cells, while preserving normal immune \nfunction [16, 17]. Similarly, by disrupting the ligand-recep-\ntor interactions of B7-1/B7-2 and CTLA-4, these interven-\ntions enable effector cells to sustain their recognition and \nkilling functions.\nIn addition to immune checkpoint inhibitors, another class \nof drugs has garnered attention due to its distinct mechanism \nof action. CD40, a member of the TNF (tumor necrosis fac-\ntor) receptor superfamily, exhibits wide distribution among \nantigen-presenting cells and plays a pivotal role in activating \nantigen-presenting cells and enhancing T cell-mediated anti-\ntumor immunity. Consequently, CD40 represents a compel-\nling antagonistic target [18–20] (Fig. 1). Activation of CD40 \nsets in motion tumor suppression through various pathways \nin diverse CD40 agonist-based combination therapy regi-\nmens. For instance, CD40-activated macrophages enhance \nthe intratumoral concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs \nby disrupting the extracellular matrix. Moreover, CD40 ago-\nnists heighten the efficacy of the adaptive immune system \nagainst tumor cells by augmenting antigen presentation, \nbolstering CD8 + T cell activity, and fostering immune cell \ninfiltration at tumor sites, effectively transforming \"cold\" \ntumors into immunologically active environments [19].\nIn summary, the discovery of immune checkpoints and \nthe evolution of clinical applications involving immune \ncheckpoint inhibitors and agonists have broadened the land-\nscape of anti-tumor treatment options, charting novel direc-\ntions for anti-tumor research and bring about a resurgence \nin the exploration of anti-tumor immunity (Clinical trials of \ndrugs targeting immune checkpoints are listed in Table 1).\nMonotherapy using single immune checkpoint \ndrugs or combinations\nBlocking the PD-1 and PD-L1 axis or preventing CTLA-4 \nbinding to its ligands with monoclonal antibodies has dem-\nonstrated definitive efficacy in many patients with solid \ntumors [21–24]. However, the clinical effectiveness of \nthis monotherapy approaching pancreatic cancer patients \nhas been disappointing. Currently, the following immune \ncheckpoint drugs are commonly employed in clinical tri-\nals and therapies for pancreatic cancer: PD-1 inhibitors \nsuch as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, camrelizumab, and"}, {"page_number": 3, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\t\nPage 3 of 28 \n64\ntoripalimab; PD-L1 inhibitors like atezolizumab and dur-\nvalumab; and CTLA-4 inhibitors including ipilimumab \nand tremelimumab.\nPembrolizumab (MK-3475), a potent PD-1-specific \nIgG4-κ humanized monoclonal antibody, obstructs the \nbinding of PD-1 to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In a \nphase I study, pembrolizumab exhibited variable efficacy \namong different advanced solid tumor patient populations, \nwith both pancreatic cancer patients experiencing disease \nprogression during treatment [25].\nSimilarly, clinical trials of anti-PD-L1 monotherapy \nhave yielded discouraging results. An early phase I trial \ninvolving seven pancreatic cancer patients treated with \nBMS-936559, a high-affinity, IgG4 human-derived anti-\nPD-L1 monoclonal antibody, failed to elicit any par-\ntial responses (PR) [26]. In another phase I study, one \nFig. 1   Current clinical immunotherapy strategies for pancreatic can-\ncer. This schematic shows the monotherapies and combined thera-\npies for pancreatic cancer.

Notably, three immunological \nadverse events of grade ≥ 3 were observed, one of which \nresulted in the patient's death. According to the response \nevaluation criteria in solid tumors, it was concluded that \nsingle-agent ipilimumab, at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg, was an \neffective therapy for pancreas adenocarcinoma [28].\nFurthermore, combination therapy involving anti-PD-1/\nL1 and anti-CTLA-4 demonstrated limited efficacy in pan-\ncreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), in contrast to its \nsuccess in other solid tumors [29, 30]. O'Reilly EM et al. \nconducted a phase II randomized clinical trial in patients \nwith metastatic PDAC, administering a combination of dur-\nvalumab, a human anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, and \ntremelimumab, a human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody. \nThe objective response rate (ORR) was 3.1% for patients \nreceiving combination therapy and 0% for those receiving \nmonotherapy [31].\nInterestingly, the combination therapy of anti-PD-L1 and \nanti-CTLA-4 demonstrated some efficacy in pancreatic neu-\nroendocrine tumors (pNETs). In a study involving a combi-\nnation of ipilimumab and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 mono-\nclonal antibody, three out of seven (43%) pNET patients \nachieved objective responses in CA209-538, particularly \nthose with high-grade tumors, including one previously \nrefractory to single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy [32]. This sug-\ngests that patients with high-grade pNETs can significantly \nbenefit from dual checkpoint blockade.\nIn summary, immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, \nwith limited data, has demonstrated little to no impact on \noverall prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. However, the \nclinical benefit observed in individual patients suggests the \ntherapeutic potential of this approach, particularly in vac-\ncinated patients who exhibit stronger responses to immune \ncheckpoint drugs [28]. Additionally, the combination strat-\negies of anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 have \nshown anti-tumor activity, especially in pNETs, although \nfurther clinical trials are required to establish their potential \nvalue. These findings underscore the need for combination \ntherapy strategies based on immune checkpoint drugs to \ncombat pancreatic cancer effectively.\nImmune checkpoint drugs combined \nwith chemotherapy\nanti‑PD‑1 combined with (m) FOLFIRINOX \nor gemcitabine‑based chemotherapy\nBoth the combination of anti-PD-1 with (modified) FOL-\nFIRINOX and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy have dem-\nonstrated superior efficacy compared to chemotherapy alone.\nA phase II study involving a combination of modified \nFOLFIRINOX, a standard adjuvant therapy for patients with \nresectable and advanced disease [3, 33–36], and nivolumab \nas a first-line treatment for 31 metastatic pancreatic can-\ncer patients yielded promising results. FOLFIRINOX was \nmodified by having a lower dose of fluorouracil compared to \nstandard FOLFIRINOX. This regimen resulted in a median \nOS of 13.40 months (90% CI 10.87–15.24) and a median \nPFS of 7.39 months (90% CI 3.88–7.59), with a 1-year sur-\nvival rate of 54.8% (90% CI 39.1–68.1%). Notably, the most \nfrequently reported grade 3–4 drug-related adverse event \nwas neutrophil count decrease (38.7%) [37]. Overall, the \naddition of a PD-1 antibody to (m) FOLFIRINOX has shown \nslight improvements over the known efficacy of (m) FOL-\nFIRINOX alone [38, 39].\nFurthermore, the CISPD-4 study, a randomized phase \nII trial investigating the combination of PD-1 antibodies \nwith modified FOLFIRINOX for borderline resectable and \nlocally advanced pancreatic cancer, is currently underway \n[40], which may provide additional positive data for this \ncombination therapy regimen.\nThe combination therapy of anti-PD-1 with gemcitabine \nand nab-paclitaxel (AG) chemotherapy as a first-line treat-\nment has also shown promising efficacy. In a previous study, \nthis combination achieved a remarkable 100% disease con-\ntrol rate (DCR) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer \nas a first-line therapy [41]. Patients in this study achieved a \nmedian OS of 15 months and a median PFS of 9.1 months. \nSimilar encouraging data regarding DCR were observed in \nother clinical trials. In a single-arm, single-center explora-\ntory study that enrolled 20 metastatic PDAC patients, cam-\nrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, combined with AG as a \nfirst-line therapy resulted in a 60% ORR and an 85% DCR \n[42]. Similarly, in a phase II trial, 80% of patients with \nadvanced pancreatic cancer achieved an ORR when treated \nwith NAPPCG (N/nivolumab plus AP/albumin-bound \npaclitaxel plus P/paricalcitol and plus C/cisplatin + G/gem-\ncitabine) as a first-line therapy, with a median PFS of 8.2 \nmonths [43].\nThe trial data mentioned above suggest that the combina-\ntion therapy of anti-PD-1 with gemcitabine-based chemo-\ntherapy elicits a stronger initial response in pancreatic can-\ncer patients. However, investigating methods to sustain this \nanti-tumor response and prolong patients' survival remains \na key area for further research. Notably, a case report docu-\nmented a patient with metastatic PDAC who achieved dura-\nble responses and tolerated well a triple combination therapy \nof toripalimab (a humanized IgG4K monoclonal antibody \nspecific for human PD-1), gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel, \neven though pseudoprogression was observed in this patient, \nsuggesting that some patients may derive substantial benefit \nfrom this protocol [44]."}, {"page_number": 6, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\n64 \nPage 6 of 28\nanti‑CTLA‑4 combined with gemcitabine\nThe safety of tremelimumab, a human monoclonal IgG2 anti-\nbody targeting CTLA-4, in combination with gemcitabine has \nbeen established in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer \n[45]. However, compared to PD-1, the results of the combina-\ntion of CTLA-4 and chemotherapy have been less optimistic. \nIn a phase I study conducted in 2020, patients with advanced \npancreatic cancer treated with ipilimumab plus gemcitabine \nachieved a median PFS of 2.5 months (95% CI 0.8–4.8) and \na median OS of 8.5 months (95% CI 2.2–10.3), which did not \nsurpass the efficacy of gemcitabine monotherapy. Common \ngrade 3 or 4 adverse events included anemia (48%), leukopenia \n(48%), and neutropenia (43%) [46].\nThe combination of anti-CTLA-4 and chemotherapy does \nnot appear to demonstrate superiority over the combination \nof PD-1 with chemotherapy, which may be attributed to dif-\nferences in chemotherapy regimens and the varying thera-\npeutic effects of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 [47].\nanti‑PD‑1 plus anti‑CTLA4 plus chemotherapy\nIn contrast to the combination of anti-CTLA-4 with gem-\ncitabine, the addition of PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies to \nchemotherapy has shown better survival benefits, albeit with \nincreased side effects. The combination of gemcitabine and \nnab-paclitaxel (Nab-P) serves as the standard first-line treat-\nment for advanced PDAC. In the recent Canadian Cancer \nTrials Group PA.7 trial (NCT02879318), a randomized \nphase II study, the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-\npaclitaxel with durvalumab and tremelimumab improved \npatients' OS (9.8 months versus 8.8 months; HR 0.94; P: \n0.72) and ORR (30.3% versus 23.0%; OR 1.49; P 0.28) com-\npared to the control group. However, there was no signifi-\ncant difference in PFS (5.5 months versus 5.4 months), and \nthe overall incidence of adverse events in the experimental \ngroup was higher (68.91% versus 44.3%) [48].\nBased on the results of clinical trials involving the com-\nbination of anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 with chemotherapy, \nit appears that the three-drug regimen combining anti-PD-1 \nand anti-CTLA-4 with chemotherapy may not warrant fur-\nther research for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This is \ndue to the fact that, in addition to the limited improvement \nin clinical benefits compared to the two-drug combination \nregimen, the tolerability of self-toxicity and side effects in \nadvanced pancreatic cancer patients remains a significant \nconcern.\nCD40 agonist combined with gemcitabine‑based \nchemotherapy\nAs early as 2011, the combination of CD40 agonistic \nmonoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as selicrelumab, with \ngemcitabine was observed to induce tumor regression in \nadvanced pancreatic cancer patients. Among 21 patients, \nfour developed a partial response, 11 had stable disease \n(SD), and four experienced disease progression (PD). The \nmedian PFS for these patients was 5.6 months (95% confi-\ndence interval, 4.0 months to not estimable), and the median \nOS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 12.8 months). This com-\nbination demonstrated better clinical benefit than histori-\ncal gemcitabine monotherapy, highlighting the potential of \nCD40 agonistic mAbs when combined with chemotherapy \n[20, 49].\nMore recently, the safety and tolerability of combination \ntherapy with CD40 agonists and AG (gemcitabine and nab-\npaclitaxel) have been demonstrated. In an open-label, mul-\nticenter, phase Ib study involving APX005M (sotigalimab), \nanother CD40 agonistic monoclonal antibody, combined \nwith chemotherapy, 14 out of 24 patients with metastatic \npancreatic adenocarcinoma responded positively, with eight \nof them receiving additional nivolumab. Common grade 3–4 \ntreatment-related adverse events included decreased lympho-\ncyte counts (20; 67%) and decreased neutrophil counts (9; \n30%). The most common serious adverse event was pyrexia \n(6 [20%] of 30) [50]. Overall, based on the observed tol-\nerability and clinical activity, this study suggests a viable \ncombination therapy option for advanced pancreatic cancer \npatients.\nHowever, in the recently published phase II results of this \nstudy, the experimental group receiving AG plus sotigali-\nmab with or without nivolumab did not exhibit improved \nefficiency compared to the control group. The 1-year OS \nrates for the two groups were 48.1% (sotigalimab plus \nchemo, p = 0.062, n = 36) and 41.3% (sotigalimab, nivo \nplus chemo, p = 0.223, n = 35), respectively. There was no \nsignificant improvement observed in ORR or PFS in either \narm [51, 52]. This lack of improvement may be attributed to \nfunctional exhaustion following T cell hyperactivation and \npotential efficacy antagonism introduced by the combination \ntherapy. While the results of this study are negative, they \nprovide crucial insights for future research into combination \ntherapy strategies and the underlying immune mechanisms \nof pancreatic cancer.\nFurthermore, the addition of CD40 agonists to neoad-\njuvant chemotherapy has demonstrated immunological \nchanges and clinical benefits. In one study, selicrelumab, \nan agonistic CD40 mAb, was added to the standard chemo-\ntherapy regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel before \nsurgery for 16 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. \nThis combination proved to have tolerable toxicity, resulting \nin an OS of 23.4 months (95% CI, 18.0–28.8 months). Addi-\ntionally, immunological changes, such as increased prolifera-\ntion and activation of T cells in the tumor microenvironment \n(TME) and a decrease in M2-like tumor-associated mac-\nrophages, were observed in postoperative patients compared"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\t\nPage 7 of 28 \n64\nto preoperative untreated patients [53]. Focusing on these \nimmunological changes within the TME under these treat-\nments may pave the way for future studies aimed at over-\ncoming the current efficacy challenges faced by regimens \ncombining CD40 agonists with chemotherapeutics.\nFor patients with pancreatic cancer, the combined treat-\nment strategy of immune checkpoint drugs with chemo-\ntherapy offers certain advantages over chemotherapy alone. \nHowever, the contradiction between chemotherapy drugs' \nimmune system-suppressing effects and the immune sys-\ntem's dependence on immune checkpoint drugs may limit \nthe efficacy of this combination strategy. Additionally, the \nrapid progression of pancreatic cancer and the immune cell \nexhaustion in its late stages weakens the immune system's \nanti-tumor capabilities, thereby limiting the clinical impact \nof immune checkpoint drugs. Furthermore, the potential \nautoimmune toxicity resulting from ICIs or CD40 agonists, \nas well as the tolerability of combination therapy, is impor-\ntant considerations before initiating treatment, particularly \nfor patients with abnormal autoimmune function or those \nwho have undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy.\nCombination of immune checkpoint drugs \nwith other drugs\nIn pancreatic cancer, the immune microenvironment char-\nacterized by immunosuppression presents a significant chal-\nlenge to the efficacy of immunotherapy. Simultaneously, \ntargeting different nodes involved in anti-tumor immuno-\nsuppression holds the theoretical promise of producing a \nsynergistic effect.\nAnti‑PD‑1 combined with anti‑colony‑stimulating factor‑1\nColony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is produced by various \ntumors and recruits cells like myeloid-derived suppressor \ncells (MDSCs) to promote immunosuppression. Preclini-\ncal data in a pancreatic cancer mouse model suggest that \nblocking CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling can lead to anti-tumor \nT cell responses and tumor regression [54, 55]. However, \nthe effectiveness of anti-PD-1 combined with anti-CSF1R \ntherapy in pancreatic cancer remains inconclusive. A study \ninvolving solid tumor patients, including those with pancre-\natic cancer, treated with 200 mg pembrolizumab plus 1100 \nmg AMG 820, an anti-CSF1R monoclonal antibody, did not \nyield sufficiently robust anti-tumor activity to warrant fur-\nther investigation [56].\nAnti‑PD‑1/L1 combined with transforming growth factor β \nreceptor inhibitor\nTransforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a multifunctional \ncytokine in the transforming growth factor superfamily \nthat promotes immunosuppression, angiogenesis, tumor \ncell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and other \ntumor-promoting processes. Blocking the TGF-β pathway \nmay sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors by \naffecting immune cell function [57–59]. Preclinical studies \nhave shown that TGF-β receptor inhibitors (TGFβ-RI) can \nefficiently block the TGF-β canonical pathway [60–62], and \ndual inhibition of TGFβ-RI and PD-L1 may synergistically \nenhance anti-tumor efficacy by downregulating PD-1 expres-\nsion while relieving TGF-β's inhibitory effects on CD8 + T \ncells [63, 64]. However, a two-part, single-arm, multina-\ntional, phase Ib study combining galunisertib, a TGF-β type \nI receptor kinase inhibitor, with durvalumab in recurrent/\nrefractory metastatic pancreatic cancer patients reported \ninconsistent results. The study showed a median OS of 5.72 \nmonths (95% CI: 4.01 to 8.38) and PFS of 1.87 months (95% \nCI: 1.58 to 3.09), with a DCR of 25.0% and a confirmed \nORR of 3.1% [65].\nSimilarly, clinical trials targeting both PD-L1 and \nTGF-β pathways have yielded pessimistic results. M7824 \n(MSB0011359C), a novel bifunctional fusion protein \nconsisting of a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against \nPD-L1 fused to the extracellular domain of TGF-β receptor \nII (TGF-βRII), was tested in a phase I study with patients \nsuffering from solid tumors. While durable and confirmed \npartial responses were observed in one of five patients (20%) \nwith pancreatic cancer [66], the overall results were not \npromising.\nAnti‑PD‑L1 combined with vascular endothelial growth \nfactor (VEGF) inhibitor\nVEGF and its receptors are essential regulators of angio-\ngenesis under normal physiological conditions. VEGF is \nexpressed in various tumors, promoting tumor angiogen-\nesis and metastasis. In the case of pancreatic cancer, most \ntumors are VEGF-positive, making it a potential target [67]. \nThe combination of anti-PD-L1 with a VEGF inhibitor has \nshown effectiveness in pNET patients. Halperin DM et al. \ntreated 20 pNET patients with atezolizumab in combination \nwith the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab.

However, clinical trials \ninvestigating the combination of anti-CCR4 and anti-PD-L1 \nat tolerated levels have not shown significant efficacy. In a \nphase I clinical trial, Zamarin D et al. enrolled 64 patients \nwith solid tumors, including 27 with pancreatic cancer, who \nwere treated with mogamulizumab, a humanized, defuco-\nsylated immunoglobulin G1 kappa mAb, in combination \nwith durvalumab or tremelimumab. Despite tolerability, the \nORR was only 5.3% (95% CI, 0.1%–26.0%), with one patient \nachieving a partial response [73]. The lackluster results may \nbe attributed to inadequate drug concentration within the \nlocal tumor to trigger pharmacological effects or the absence \nof specific immune cell types in the pancreatic cancer tumor \nmicroenvironment, limiting the anti-tumor efficacy of CCR4 \nmAb. Additionally, the associated depletion of effector T cell \npopulations may counteract the positive therapeutic effects \nof Treg depletion.\nAnti‑PD‑1 combined with inhibitor of CXCR4‑CXCL12 axis\nThe COMBAT trial has shown promising signs of efficacy \nin combining anti-PD-1 therapy with a CXCR4 inhibitor \nand chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer patients. This trial \nenrolled patients with metastatic PDAC who had progressed \nafter first-line therapy. They were subsequently treated with \nBL-8040 (a CXCR4 antagonist) and pembrolizumab as \nsecond-line regimens. The results indicated a median OS of \n7.5 months. In the expansion cohort, where the NAPOLI-1 \nregimen (nanosome irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin) \nwas added, the ORR, DCR, and median persistence were \n32%, 77%, and 7.8 months, respectively, for the experimen-\ntal group consisting of 22 patients [74]. However, subse-\nquent data for 43 patients treated with this regimen showed \na decrease in ORR (21%), DCR (63.02%), and median dura-\ntion of clinical benefit (5.7 months) compared to previous \ndata. In the intention-to-treat population, median PFS was \n3.8 months, and median OS was 6.6 months. Importantly, \nthe triple combination was safe and well-tolerated, with a \nlow incidence of grade 3 or higher neutropenia and infection \n(7%) [75]. These alterations in efficacy may be attributed to \nthe modulation of tumor immunosuppression in pancreatic \ncancer.\nConversely, a clinical study involving anti-CXCL12 \n(NOX-A12) showed positive results. In patients with micro-\nsatellite-stable disease, unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy, \ncotreatment with a 2-week start-up period of NOX-A12 fol-\nlowed by pembrolizumab resulted in disease stabilization \nobserved in 2 (22%) of nine patients. Clinical activity was \nalso observed in other patients, characterized by signifi-\ncantly longer treatment duration than before [76]. Given that \nchemotherapeutic drugs can increase the exposure of tumor \nneoantigens to the immune environment through direct cell \ndestruction and that inhibition of the CXCR4-CXCL12 \npathway can reprogram the tumor microenvironment \n[77–79], the combination of chemotherapy and CXCR4-\nCXCL12 pathway blockade holds significant promise.\nImmune checkpoint drugs combined with kinase inhibitor\nBruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a non-receptor kinase, has \nbeen implicated in the immunosuppressive function of mye-\nloid-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment [80, 81]. \nWhile BTK inhibitors have shown the ability to inhibit pan-\ncreatic cancer progression in mouse models [82], the clinical \ncombination therapy of a PD-1 inhibitor with a BTK inhibi-\ntor has demonstrated poor efficacy. A randomized phase II \nstudy evaluating pembrolizumab and acalabrutinib in com-\nparison with acalabrutinib alone in patients with advanced \npancreatic cancer failed to reveal a significant improvement \nin the ORR (7.9%, 95% CI: 1.7% to 21.4% in the combina-\ntion therapy arm, versus 0%, 95% CI: 0% to 10%, in the \nmonotherapy arm) and median PFS (1.4 months, 95% CI: 1.3 \nto 1.4 months, and 1.4 months, 95% CI: 1.3 to 1.5 months) \n[83]. Furthermore, the study did not assess changes in \nMDSCs and T cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment.\nSimilarly, anlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting \nVEGF receptors 2, has shown the ability to reduce vascular \ndensity in tumor tissue and inhibit tumor growth [84, 85]. \nHowever, combining a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with \nPD-1 therapy in pancreatic cancer has not improved patient \nsurvival. In an observational, prospective study involving \npatients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the combination \nregimen of anlotinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies resulted in \nthe worst PFS compared to other solid tumors, with a PFS of \n1.61 months versus 8.37 months (95% CI: 6.5–10.0 months) \n[86].\nLikewise, the phase Ia/Ib PACT study demonstrated the \nstable safety and durable clinical activity of LY3300054, a \nnew PD-L1 inhibitor with a modified Fc domain that pre-\nvents PD-L1–expressing T cell depletion. However, com-\nbinations of this drug with tyrosine-protein kinase (MET) \ninhibitors have been less effective in patients with pancre-\natic cancer. After treatment with LY3300054 and merestinib \n(a type II MET kinase inhibitor), most pancreatic cancer \npatients experienced disease progression [87]. Moreover, in \na recent phase Ib clinical trial, the combination of avelumab \n(a PD-L1 blocking human IgG1 monoclonal antibody) \nand binimetinib (a small-molecule MEK1/2 inhibitor) also \nshowed limited clinical activity in metastatic pancreatic \nductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) patients [88].\nImmune checkpoint drugs combined with kinase inhibitor \nand chemotherapy\nThe incorporation of chemotherapy agents alongside ICIs \nand kinase inhibitors appears to ameliorate the unfavorable"}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\t\nPage 9 of 28 \n64\noutcome associated with the two-drug combination regimen. \nFocal adhesion kinase (FAK), a tyrosine kinase overacti-\nvated in the majority of PDAC and linked to a poor progno-\nsis, was targeted in a recent multicenter, open-label, phase \n1 study. The three-drug combination of defactinib, a small-\nmolecule FAK inhibitor, pembrolizumab, and gemcitabine, \ndemonstrated good tolerability and safety in patients with \nadvanced refractory pancreatic cancer. Notably, among the \n10 evaluable patients, one achieved a PR, seven showed SD, \nand two exhibited PD [89].\nImmune checkpoint drugs combined with PARP inhibitors \nand platinum‑based therapy\nNiraparib, a poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibi-\ntor inhibiting DNA repair and inducing tumor cell death, \nsignificantly enhanced progression-free survival in patients \nwith advanced ovarian cancer. In a recent randomized phase \nIb/II study of niraparib combined with nabuliumab or ipili-\nmumab in patients with platinum-sensitive advanced pancre-\natic cancer [90], despite 50% of patients experiencing grade \n3–4 treatment-related AEs, the nira/ipi group was deemed \nsuperior due to a 59.6% progression-free survival rate at \n6 months (PFS6) and a 17.3-month mOS as opposed to the \nnira/nivo group [91]. This precision targeting strategy may \noffer personalized immune drug selection for patients with \ndistinct characteristics.\nImmune checkpoint drugs combined with activator \nof the Toll‑like receptor 9 pathway\nPixatimod, a compound augmenting innate immunity by \nactivating the Toll-like receptor 9 pathway, has been reported \nto potentially enhance the efficacy of ICIs. Unfortunately, a \nphase Ib open-label multicenter study of solid tumors treated \nwith nivolumab revealed no responders among 18 mPDAC \npatients [92]. This implies that augmenting the anti-tumor \ncapability of innate immunity may not eliminate T cell \nrejection and restriction in advanced PDAC; yet, we believe \nthat enhancing the innate immune system may exert a more \npotent effect on early-stage pancreatic cancer treatment.\nIt is apparent that drugs targeting immune system sup-\npression have clinical efficacy limitations. Contributing fac-\ntors may include:\na.\t Recruitment of patients with a history of multiple failed \ntreatments in trials, potentially leading to unknown \nchanges in tumor-localized microenvironments.\nb.\t Heterogeneity in local tumor cellular composition and \nan insufficient number of recruited patients in studies.\nc.\t Persistence of immunosuppressive components in the \ntumor microenvironment and the emergence of adaptive \nresistance mechanisms.\nd.\t Challenges in achieving adequate drug penetration \ninto local tumor sites and maintaining sustained effects \nwithin the tumor microenvironment.\nNevertheless, research in this area warrants attention and \nongoing exploration to enhance our comprehension of the \nlocal environment and molecular mechanisms of pancreatic \ncancer.\nTherapeutic regimen based on immune checkpoint \ndrugs and radiotherapy\nRadiation therapy is believed to induce a distal anti-tumor \nimmune response through the abscopal effect, enhancing \ntumor cell sensitivity to immune cell killing. The combina-\ntion with ICIs may potentially reverse the cold tumor char-\nacteristics of pancreatic cancer. In a single-arm, non-rand-\nomized, phase 2 trial combining radiation, ipilimumab, and \nnivolumab in patients with metastatic microsatellite-stable \n(MSS) PDAC, a response was observed in patients receiv-\ning radiation therapy, with a DCR of 29% (5/17; 95%CI: \n10–56%), and an ORR of 18% (3/17; 95%CI: 4–43%). This \nstudy confirms the ability of radiation therapy to improve \nthe response rate to immunotherapy [93].\nThe safety of ICIs combined with stereotactic body radio-\ntherapy (SBRT) was demonstrated in a phase I clinical trial \n[94]. In another randomized phase II study of nivolumab \nwith or without ipilimumab combined with SBRT, there \nwere also positive results for refractory metastatic pancreatic \ncancer. Compared to patients treated with SBRT/nivolumab, \nthose in the SBRT nivolumab/ipilimumab group achieved \na higher clinical benefit rate (CBR) (37.2% vs. 17.1%) and \na higher percentage of patients who achieved a PR (14.0% \nvs. 2.4%). In conclusion, the regimen exhibited clinically \nsignificant anti-tumor activity and a good safety profile [95].\nSimilarly, the addition of anti-PD-1 therapy plus KRAS \ninhibitor to chemoradiotherapy regimens has demonstrated \nboth safety and improved efficacy when compared to control \ngroups. In a phase II study involving 198 patients with post-\noperative local recurrence of pancreatic cancer characterized \nby mutant KRAS and positive immunohistochemical stain-\ning of PD-L1, eligible participants received chemotherapy \n(mFOLFIRINOX or 5-fluorouracil). Following this, they \nwere administered SBRT (35–40 Gy in five fractions), intra-\nvenous pembrolizumab (200 mg/3 weeks), and trametinib \n(2 mg/day) or SBRT (with the same regimen) and intra-\nvenous gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and 8 of a \n21-day cycle for eight cycles. The results indicated that the \ngroup receiving SBRT plus pembrolizumab and trametinib \nachieved a median OS of 24.9 months (95% CI 23.3–26.5), \nwhereas the control group (SBRT + gemcitabine) had a \nmedian OS of 22.4 months (95% CI 21.2–23 6). This dem-\nonstrated a notable improvement with a hazard ratio (HR)"}, {"page_number": 10, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\n64 \nPage 10 of 28\nof 0.60 (95% CI 0.44–0.82; p = 0.0012). The most common \ngrade 3 or 4 adverse effects observed were increased alanine \naminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (ten [12%] \nof 85 in SBRT plus pembrolizumab and trametinib group \nvs. six [7%] of 85 in SBRT plus gemcitabine group) [96].\nHowever, the outcomes of a phase II study examining the \neffectiveness of a multi-drug combination involving ICIs and \nradiotherapy for refractory pancreatic cancer were not as \npromising as anticipated. At the data cutoff, no response was \nobserved in 26 patients treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab, \ntocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody), \nand SBRT. Five patients (19%; 95%CI, 7–39) demonstrated \nstability. The median overall survival was 5.3  months \n(95%CI 2.3–8.0). Furthermore, 19 patients (73%) experi-\nenced treatment-related adverse events. This outcome may \nbe associated with the intricate role of IL-6 in the specific \ntumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer [97].\nIn general, the efficacy of ICIs in combination with radio-\ntherapy or chemoradiotherapy met expectations and indeed \nenhanced the adaptive anti-tumor immune response. How-\never, the effectiveness of incorporating other types of drugs \ninto this combination strategy varies. The amalgamation of \nprecise radiotherapy with more personalized and diversified \nimmunotherapy regimens may represent one of the avenues \nto unlock the therapeutic potential of ICIs in the future.\nImmune checkpoint drugs plus other treatments\nOncolytic viruses, capable of entering tumor cells and caus-\ning persistent killing without harming normal tissues, hold \npromise for selective anti-tumor effects and promoting anti-\ntumor immune responses, particularly when utilizing wild-\ntype or gene-edited viruses. Pelareorep, an intravenously \ndelivered oncolytic reovirus, has shown safety and efficacy \nin combination with chemotherapy for various malignant \ntumors [98, 99]. However, its application in pancreatic can-\ncer patients has yet to yield positive clinical results. In a \nphase Ib study, pelareorep and pembrolizumab were added \nto chemotherapy. This combination led to encouraging effi-\ncacy, with three out of 10 patients achieving disease control, \none patient experiencing a partial response, and two patients \nachieving stable disease, which persisted for 9 and 4 months, \nrespectively [100].\nIn a noncontrolled, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clini-\ncal trial, seven patients with first-line treatment-resistant \nmPDAC were given oncolytic parvovirus (H-1PV, ParvO-\nryx). Two out of seven achieved PR and lived up to 326 \nand 555 days, respectively. In addition, ParvOryx was well-\ntolerated by the patients [101].\nEvofosfamide, an investigational hypoxia-activated prod-\nrug, holds promise in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In a \nrecent phase I dose-escalation study combining ipilimumab \nwith evofosfamide in advanced pancreatic cancer patients, \nwhile no patients achieved a confirmed partial response, \nfive out of seven patients exhibited stable disease [102]. The \nsafety of this combination was demonstrated, and responders \ndisplayed increased proliferation of peripheral T cells and \ngreater infiltration of intratumoral T cells into the hypoxic \ntumor microenvironment, providing a basis for further inves-\ntigation of this combination therapy.\nMoreover, immune checkpoint drugs combined with \ntopical therapy, specifically electroporation, have been \nexplored in the context of pancreatic cancer. Depletion of \ntumor stroma has the potential to enhance the killing of \ntumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus synergizing \nwith immunotherapy [103, 104]. Irreversible electropora-\ntion (IRE), a surgical therapy that directly damages cancer \ntissue, has also been employed in patients with PDAC [105, \n106]. The combination of IRE and anti-PD-1 therapy has \ndemonstrated impressive safety and efficacy. In a phase Ib \nclinical trial involving 10 patients with stage 4, unresectable \npancreatic cancer, two patients did not receive planned treat-\nment and relapsed at 3 months. The remaining eight patients \nachieved a median PFS of 6.8 months (95% CI 3.5–10.0). \nThe median OS reached 18 months (95% CI 9.2–26.8), with \nonly one patient experiencing a nivolumab-related adverse \nevent. The most common adverse reactions included pain, \nfatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertension. Encouraged by \nthese positive results, a phase II trial is currently underway \n[107].\nWhile the combination of ICIs with oncolytic viruses, \nadjuvants, or electroporation has demonstrated varying clini-\ncal effects, it suggests that non-traditional treatment meth-\nods may enhance anti-tumor effects within the context of \nimmunotherapy. Research into these effective non-traditional \ntreatments represents a critical aspect of the battle against \npancreatic cancer, and further clinical trials are essential to \nfully realize their potential.\nIn summary, mounting evidence suggests that monother-\napy with anti-PD-1/L1, anti-CTLA-4, and CD40 agonists \nhas limited clinical efficacy in pancreatic cancer patients. \nCombination strategies involving immune checkpoint block-\nades and therapies or drugs targeting various mechanisms, \nparticularly radiotherapy and oncolytic viruses, have shown \nsome improvements in outcomes, although the variability \nand magnitude of improvement remain limited. This may \nbe attributed to the challenging-to-reverse tumor microen-\nvironment of pancreatic cancer, which hinders the sustained \naction of drugs and anti-tumor immune cells. As a result, \nefforts are focused on identifying ways to modify the tumor \nmicroenvironment of pancreatic cancer, thereby enhancing \nanti-tumor activity. This includes investigating new mecha-\nnisms for inhibiting tumor development, discovering novel \nimmune checkpoints to optimize immune cell anti-tumor \nfunctions, and developing additional combination treatment \nstrategies."}, {"page_number": 11, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\t\nPage 11 of 28 \n64\nTreatment options targeting tumors \nand blood vessels\nSince the pioneering use of hybridoma technology to cre-\nate highly specific monoclonal antibodies in 1975 [108], \nthe monoclonal antibody industry has continued to expand \nand plays an indispensable role in immunology and tumor \ntherapy. Despite their high specificity and pharmacological \nadvantages, monoclonal antibodies face several challenges \nin their application, such as off-target effects, limitations \nrelated to antibody size, and the risk of immune responses. \nTo address these issues, various approaches have been \nexplored, including humanization technology, Fc region \nmodification, the design of drug delivery platforms targeting \ntumor cells, and the development of bispecific antibodies, all \nof which show promise [109].\nTumor-associated antigens, typically overexpressed on \nthe surface of tumor cells and under-expressed or absent in \nnormal cells, play crucial roles in tumor development, migra-\ntion, and intercellular communication [110, 111]. Targeting \nthese antigens can directly inhibit or kill tumors through \nvarious mechanisms. The following sections describe four \ntypes of monoclonal antibodies targeting tumors and blood \nvessels currently under investigation in pancreatic cancer \nclinical research (Fig. 1). Relevant drug information and \nclinical trials are also listed in Table 1.\nBlocking cell growth factor signaling\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor \nplus gemcitabine\nThe combination of erlotinib (an oral EGFR inhibitor) and \npanitumumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibit-\ning EGFR-expressing tumors) with gemcitabine in patients \nwith advanced pancreatic cancer demonstrated improved \nmedian OS (8.3 months versus 4.2 months; HR, 0.817; 95% \nCI, 0.530–1.260; p = 0.1792) and PFS (3.6 months versus \n2.0 months; HR, 0.843; 95% CI, 0.555–1.280; p = 0.4190). \nHowever, this improved efficacy was accompanied by \nincreased toxicity, with patients in the experimental group \nexperiencing a higher frequency of grade 3 and higher non-\nhematologic toxicities (82.6% vs. 52.2%; p = 0.0018) [112]. \nThese findings do not support this regimen as a superior \ntreatment option.\nEGFR inhibitor plus gemcitabine plus radiotherapy\nIn a prospective phase II study, patients with locally \nadvanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) received maintenance \ntherapy with gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus cetuximab, a \nmonoclonal antibody targeting EGFR, following a combi-\nnation therapy consisting of cetuximab, gemcitabine, and \nintensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The results \nindicated that the addition of cetuximab did not improve the \nsurvival benefit of patients after chemoradiotherapy, with a \n13-month median OS showing no clear advantage compared \nto historical data [113].\nEGFR plus HER2 inhibitor plus gemcitabine\nIn a phase II multicenter study, first-line therapy in \nadvanced pancreatic cancer patients involved gemcitabine, \ntrastuzumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2 \nreceptor), and erlotinib. The study observed partial tumor \nresponses in 19% of patients, disease stabilization in 56%, \nand a DCR of 74.6% (95% CI: 61.8–85.0; 44/59 patients). \nThe median PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI: 2.4–3.8), and the \nmedian OS was 7.9 months (95% CI: 5.1–10.2) [114]. How-\never, this combination did not demonstrate clear superiority \nover standard therapy.\nInducing apoptosis\nDR5 agonist plus gemcitabine\nDeath receptor 5 (DR5), a cell surface receptor of the TNF-\nreceptor superfamily, mediates apoptosis. Conatumumab, \nwhich binds to and activates DR5, can induce tumor cell \napoptosis. In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II \nstudy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, the \ncombination of conatumumab and gemcitabine resulted in \na 6-month survival rate of 59% (42–73) compared to 50% \n(33–64) in the gemcitabine arm, with neutropenia being the \nmost common grade ≥ 3 adverse event [115]. Additionally, a \ncombination of tigatuzumab (a humanized monoclonal anti-\nbody activating DR5) and gemcitabine demonstrated clinical \nactivity in a phase II trial involving patients with advanced \nunresectable pancreatic cancer. The study reported a PFS \nof 52.5% (95% CI, 39.3–64.1%) at 4 months, with the most \ncommon adverse events being nausea (35.5%) and fatigue \n(32.3%) [116]. Both studies support further research into \ndrugs with apoptosis-inducing mechanism.\nAnti‑mesothelin\nMesothelin, an antigen differentially expressed on the sur-\nface of tumors and normal cells, is a potentially effective \ntarget for pancreatic cancer. LMB-100, a conjugate of a mes-\nothelin antibody and pseudomonas toxin A, demonstrated \nlimited effectiveness in a phase I study involving patients \nwith advanced solid tumors [117].

These \nresults may further underscore that antibody–drug conju-\ngates (ADCs) targeting mesothelin are unlikely to revolu-\ntionize advanced pancreatic cancer therapy.\nTargeting angiogenesis‑VEGF inhibitor \nplus chemotherapy regimens\nBevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor, showed tolerability and \nclinical activity when combined with gemcitabine in patients \nwith pancreatic cancer [119]. Additionally, heavily pre-\ntreated patients with advanced solid tumors demonstrated \ngood tolerability and safety when treated with AG (albu-\nmin-bound paclitaxel and gemcitabine) plus bevacizumab. \nAmong the 15 patients with pancreatic cancer, one achieved \npartial response with a 57% reduction in tumor size, and 10 \n(67%) had stable disease [120].\nA phase I/II multicenter single-arm study of FABLOx \n(Metronomic 5-Fluorouracil Plus nab-Paclitaxel, Bevaci-\nzumab, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin) in patients with meta-\nstatic pancreatic cancer revealed the regimen's tolerability. \nThe most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were abdominal \npain and fatigue.

However, the phase II data alone \nare insufficient to draw positive conclusions, but the confir-\nmation of safety in these trials has paved the way for subse-\nquent clinical investigations.\nIn summary, monoclonal antibodies targeting cell growth \nsignals have not shown superior efficacy in pancreatic can-\ncer, even when combined with systemic chemotherapy. The \npotential of apoptosis-inducing strategies in combination \nwith chemotherapy warrants further investigation, but the \noutlook may be uncertain at present. The effectiveness of \ntargeting stroma and blood vessels in combination with \nchemotherapy remains unclear.\nTumor vaccine\nTumor vaccines constitute a vital component of contem-\nporary tumor immunotherapy, leveraging tumor cells or \ntumor antigen components to stimulate specific immune \nand humoral responses within the patient's immune system. \nThis process enhances the body's ability to detect and com-\nbat tumors. Tumor vaccines encompass whole-cell vaccines, \ndendritic cell (DC) vaccines, peptide-based vaccines, and \nnucleic acid (DNA and mRNA) vaccines (Fig. 1). These \nvaccines differ in their mechanisms, and their combination \ntherapies yield varying outcomes in clinical trials (Table 1).\nWhole‑cell vaccines\nWhole-cell vaccines involve the use of irradiated or other-\nwise treated self or allogeneic tumor cells, rendering them \nincapable of proliferation while retaining their immuno-\ngenicity. These vaccines, as a whole, can elicit anti-tumor \nimmune responses within the body. Whole-cell vaccines \noffer multiple potential antigens, reducing the likelihood of \nantigen loss and enhancing immune responses to varying \ndegrees.\nCombination of whole‑cell vaccine and chemotherapy: \nCRS‑207 plus cyclophosphamide (Cy) plus GVAX\nGVAX is a granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating fac-\ntor (GM-CSF) gene-transfected tumor cell vaccine. It relies \non two irradiated, GM-CSF-secreting allogeneic PDA cell \nlines. In the context of the GVAX pancreatic vaccine, low-\ndose cyclophosphamide was added as a neoadjuvant chem-\notherapy regimen, offering superior benefits over GVAX \nalone. Notably, the regimen induced tertiary lymphoid struc-\ntures and anti-tumor immunological changes, such as Treg \ndepletion, in most subsequent specimens. This suggests that \nvaccination can alter the \"non-immunogenic\" characteristics \nof pancreatic cancer by enhancing immune-infiltrating cells \nin the TME. However, the median survival of 4.3 months \nfell short of expectations [122, 123]. Nevertheless, given the \nobserved immunological changes, the inclusion of CY when \nusing GVAX appears to be a consensus.\nLe DT and colleagues invested significant efforts in stud-\nying the combined therapeutic approach of GVAX and CRS-\n207, a tumor vaccine utilizing Listeria bacteria to activate \nthe immune response to mesothelin. Their findings indicated \nthat heterologous prime/boost with Cy/GVAX and CRS-207 \nas third-line therapy significantly improved OS in metastatic \npancreatic cancer patients compared to Cy plus GVAX (6.1 \nmonths vs. 3.9 months; HR, 0.59; p = 0.02) in a phase II \nstudy [124]. Subsequently, after demonstrating the regimen's \ntolerability, the authors conducted a controlled experiment \ncomparing this regimen to conventional chemotherapy. The \nresults suggested that, in comparison with conventional \nchemotherapy, treatment with Cy/GVAX plus CRS-207 or \nCRS-207 monotherapy did not significantly improve sur-\nvival. The data showed median OS values of 3.7 (95% CI \n2.9–5.3), 5.4 (95% CI 4.2–6.4), and 4.6 (95% CI 4.2–5.7) \nmonths and PFS of approximately 2.2 months for all arms, \nincluding the group receiving chemotherapy [125].\nAdditionally, based on these two studies, the authors per-\nformed immunological analyses of patients with prolonged \nsurvival using single-cell mass cytometry and identified"}, {"page_number": 13, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\t\nPage 13 of 28 \n64\ntwo cell subsets associated with improved OS: CD8( +)\nCD45RO(-)CCR7(-)CD57( +) cells and CD14( +)CD33( +)\nCD85j( +) cells. The former subset was more abundant, and \nthe latter less so [126].\nCombination of whole‑cell vaccine and immune checkpoint \ndrugs\nThe combination of tumor vaccines and ICIs has shown \npromise in preclinical models. This combination, along \nwith low-dose cyclophosphamide and PD-1 blockade, can \ninhibit the immunosuppressive function of Tregs and the \nPD-1/L1 axis, enhancing the CD8 + T cell responses induced \nby tumor vaccines [127, 128].\nHowever, the role of immune checkpoint antibodies in \ncombination with whole-cell vaccines remains controver-\nsial. In another study by Tsuji Kawa T et al., Cy/GVAX \nand CRS-207 were combined with nivolumab. Although the \nexperiment maintained a good safety profile, there was no \nsignificant improvement in OS, DCR, and median PFS in the \nexperimental group compared to the control group without \nnivolumab (median OS: 5.9 [95% CI, 4.7–8.6] vs. 6.1 [95% \nCI, 3.5–7.0] months, HR: 0.86 [95% CI, 0.55–1.34]; DCR: \n13.7% vs. 9.5%; median PFS: approximately 2.2 months for \nboth arms). Moreover, the 12-month and 18-month OS rates \ntrended less impressively in the experimental group com-\npared to the control group [129].\nIn contrast, the combination of the pancreatic can-\ncer GVAX vaccine (with low-dose cyclophosphamide), \nnivolumab, and urelumab (an anti-CD137 agonist antibody \nthat enhances T-cell immunity) as adjuvant or neoadjuvant \ntherapy in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer has \ndemonstrated potential efficacy. In comparison with the \ngroup of patients receiving only the GVAX vaccine, those \nadministered the three-drug combination exhibited a sig-\nnificant increase in disease-free survival (33.51 months vs. \n13.90 months, HR = 0.55, p = 0.242) and overall survival \n(35.55 months vs. 23.59 months, HR = 0.59, p = 0.377). \nAdditionally, an augmentation in activated cytotoxic T cells \nwithin the tumor was observed. However, this promising \ntrial had certain limitations, including a smaller enrollment \nin the three-drug combination group and a higher proportion \nreceiving adjuvant (m) FOLFIRINOX [130].\nIt is worth noting that patients treated with GVAX and \nthe CTLA-4 antagonist ipilimumab experienced significant \nchanges in the TCR repertoire [129]. In addition, ipilimumab \ntreatment led to the expansion of clones associated with \nlonger survival. However, when a phase II study of GVAX \ncombined with ipilimumab was conducted, this regimen \nfailed to improve OS compared to the addition of ICIs (HR: \n1.85, 95% CI: 1.03–3.33, p = 0.036) and was prematurely \nclosed. Nonetheless, improvements in immune cell infil-\ntration following treatment were observed in both studies. \nTherefore, the combination therapy of tumor vaccination and \nICIs warrants further investigation [131].\nIn conclusion, whole-cell vaccines, whether as mono-\ntherapy or in combination with immunotherapies, have not \ndemonstrated superior therapeutic outcomes compared to \ntraditional regimens. However, given the consistently low \ntoxicity of immunotherapy and the advanced stage of disease \nprogression in the primary study population, future develop-\nments in therapeutic strategies based on whole-cell vaccines \nhold promise.\nDC vaccine\nDCs, known for their potent antigen-presenting abilities, \nserve as the crucial link between antigens and immune \nresponses. DC-based anticancer vaccines employ native or \npatient-derived dendritic cells loaded with various forms \nof antigens in vitro to generate antigen-specific cytotoxic \nT cells. This approach results in the targeted destruction of \ntumor cells.\nDC vaccine monotherapy\npMUC1-peptide pulsed dendritic cells (DCs):\nMucin 1 (MUC1), an extensively studied tumor-asso-\nciated antigen (TAA), is aberrantly expressed in various \nmalignancies [132–134]. In a phase I trial, autologous DCs \npulsed with MUC-1 and subcutaneously administered to \ninduce an immune response demonstrated safety in seven \npatients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Additionally, \nthe vaccine induced anti-tumor immune responses against \nMUC-1[135].\nAllogeneic lysate-dendritic cells (DCs):\nIn a phase I study involving a DC vaccine loaded with an \nallogeneic tumor cell lysate derived from multiple myeloma \ncell lines as adjuvant therapy, 10 pancreatic cancer patients \nwho underwent surgical resection and received standard-of-\ncare with no radiographic progression observed achieved an \n80% 1-year disease-free survival rate. While the expected \nmedian OS and median PFS were not met, 70% of patients \nexperienced no disease progression or recurrence during a \nmedian follow-up of 25 months [136].\nDC vaccine plus chemotherapy plus immune cell therapy\nZoledronate-pulsed DCs (Zol-DCs) vaccine plus gemcit-\nabine plus T cell therapy:\nIn addition to combination with chemotherapy, integrat-\ning other agents with distinct mechanisms enriches the thera-\npeutic strategy for DC vaccines.

Eight patients were assessed as \nhaving stable disease and progressive disease at day 56. \nThe experimental median OS was 7.7 months; a notable \nimprovement compared to the 4.2 to 4.9 months median OS \nachieved with second-line chemotherapy regimens for meta-\nstatic pancreatic cancer patients. This regimen was well-\ntolerated, with fatigue and self-limiting flu-like symptoms \nas the most common side effects. Although the experiment \nlacked data on immune changes in the tumor microenviron-\nment post-treatment, the regimen exhibited superiority over \nexisting standard treatment regimens [139].\nPersonalized neoantigen peptides (PEP‑DC) plus nivolumab \nplus SOC chemotherapy plus aspirin\nIn a phase Ib trial, a novel proteo-genomic antigen discovery \npipeline was designed for neoantigen prediction and selec-\ntion. The trial combined nivolumab with chemotherapy in \na treatment approach based on tumor vaccines. Aspirin was \nadded to suppress immunosuppressive cells. CD4 + T cell \nresponses against PEP candidates were detected in all three \ndonors, although CD8 + T cell responses were not observed. \nThis protocol highlights the feasibility of neoantigen vaccine \nproduction [140], offering innovative prospects for future \nvaccine treatment strategies.\nWhile DC vaccine monotherapy has exhibited safety in \nearlier studies [135], its clinical benefits for pancreatic can-\ncer have been modest. Conversely, combining DC vaccines \nwith chemotherapy shows promise, and the inclusion of \ntoll-like receptor (TLR)-3 agonists demonstrates favorable \nefficacy. The exploration of neoantigens in follow-up studies \nholds great potential for future vaccine treatment strategies.\nPeptide vaccines\nPeptide vaccines, compared to other vaccine types, offer \nthe advantage of lower toxicity and simplified synthesis. \nHowever, this ease of use comes with the potential for \nreduced immunogenicity. Hence, the active use of adju-\nvants or immunomodulators becomes crucial to elicit \nrobust responses. Despite extensive clinical trials, peptide \nvaccines derived from sources such as telomerase have not \ndemonstrated a significant clinical efficacy when compared \nto standard chemotherapy. Therefore, the potential of neoan-\ntigen vaccines holds promise for future developments.\nPeptide vaccines monotherapy\nPersonalized peptide vaccination (PPV):\nA retrospective study conducted in 2021 explored iNeo-\nVac-P01, a personalized neoantigen-based peptide vaccine, \nin seven advanced pancreatic cancer patients with low tumor \nmutation burden (TMB). Concurrent administration of other \ntreatments, including ICIs, was permitted. The vaccine was \nwell-tolerated, with no significant vaccine-related adverse \nimmune reactions reported. Patients exhibited a mean OS \nof 24.1 months, vaccine-related OS of 8.3 months, and PFS \nof 3.1 months. The DCR reached 85.71%, and the 1-year \nsurvival rate approached 50%. A substantial increase in \nantigen-specific TCR clones was observed in one patient \nwho achieved long-term survival, suggesting iNeo-Vac-P01's \npotential to activate specific T cell subsets against tumor \ncells [141].

One patient achieved partial response, and the \nremaining six demonstrated stable disease. Notably, delayed-\ntype hypersensitivity (DTH) responses specific to WT1 pep-\ntides were detected in four of the seven patients. Patients \nwith a robust DTH response to WT1 peptide exhibited \nimproved survival. The regimen also maintained a favorable \nsafety profile, with grade 1 skin reactions at the vaccination \nsite, mirroring those reported in previous gemcitabine trials. \nAdditionally, vaccination promoted the long-term mainte-\nnance of WT1-specific memory CD8 + T cells [142, 143].\nYanagisawa R et al. conducted a phase I trial involv-\ning patients with surgically resected pancreatic cancer. \nThe patient was administered a three-drug combination \nof antigen-pulsed DCs loaded with WT1 peptides (highly \nexpressed in pancreatic cancer), S-1, and OK-432 (an adju-\nvant for the WT1-DC vaccine). No significant adverse effects \nwere reported, and seven out of eight patients with surgically \nresected pancreatic cancer exhibited durable WT1-specific \nCTL immune responses. A 2-year OS rate of approximately \n62.5% suggests its potential as a treatment option [144]. The \nregimen's superiority, stemming from these results, indicates \nits therapeutic potential, especially when combined with \nchemotherapy.\nSVN-2B plus gemcitabine and/or tegafur/gimeracil/\noteracil plus IFN beta(ADJUVANT).\nA study involving 29 patients with metastatic pancre-\natic cancer, who had previously failed gemcitabine-based \ntherapy, investigated KIF20A-66, an HLA-A24-restricted \npeptide vaccine derived from KIF20A. Among the patients \nwho completed at least one course of treatment, 21 achieved \nstable disease, while eight experienced progressive disease \n[145]. This outcome underscores the potential activity of \nthe vaccine.\nSimilarly, SVN-2B, another HLA-A24-restricted pep-\ntide vaccine with IFN-β as an adjuvant, was evaluated in 83 \nHLA-A24-positive pancreatic cancer patients. These patients \nwere divided into three groups: SVN-2B plus IFN-β, SVN-\n2B alone, and a placebo group. Although differences in PFS \nand DCR were evident among the three groups, the variance \nin OS was less pronounced (102 days, 96.5 days, and 111 \ndays, respectively; p = 0.4565). However, an increase in sur-\nviving 2B-specific CTLs was observed in the SVN‐2B plus \nIFN-β group, suggesting potential for long-term survival \nimprovement [146].\nOCV-C01 plus gemcitabine:\nOCV-C01, comprising epitope peptides from KIF20A, \nVEGFR1, and VEGFR2, combined with gemcitabine \nresulted in a higher median DFS of 15.8 months in 30 \nresected pancreatic cancer patients (95% CI, 11.1–20.6), \ncompared to gemcitabine alone (DFS 12.0 months). Fur-\nthermore, the DFS rate at 18 months reached 34.6% (95% \nCI, 18.3–51.6), with median OS not reached. The OS rate at \n18 months was 69.0% (95% CI, 48.8–82.5). The combination \nwas well-tolerated, with no significant differences in adverse \neffects between gemcitabine plus OCV-C01 and gemcitabine \nalone (p = 0.504). Nonetheless, this non-randomized trial \nand the low expression rate of KIF20A suggest the need for \na larger sample size for more conclusive results [147].\nDifferent combination regimens of peptide vaccines and \nchemotherapy exhibit varying efficacy among groups of pan-\ncreatic cancer patients. Overall, they demonstrate reliable \nsafety profiles but fall short of significantly improving OS. \nThese findings underscore the need to address performance \nlimitations despite their favorable safety profiles.\nnucleic acid vaccine\nDNA vaccine plus chemotherapy\nAlgenpantucel-L plus neoadjuvant SOC chemotherapy \n(FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel):\nAlgenpantucel-L (AL) is an allogeneic pancreatic can-\ncer vaccine designed based on the concept of hyperacute \nrejection. It consists of two human pancreatic ductal adeno-\ncarcinoma cell lines genetically engineered to express αGal \nthrough retroviral transfer using the murine αGT gene [148]. \nA recent phase III study aimed to assess the potential of AL \nas a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen to enhance patient \noutcomes. In this study, 303 patients with borderline resecta-\nble or locally advanced PDAC were divided into two groups. \nGroup A received neoadjuvant standard-of-care chemother-\napy (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel), while \ngroup B received the same standard neoadjuvant regimen \nwith the addition of HAPa immunotherapy.

It is evident that the incorporation of AL did not result \nin improvement.\nDNA vaccine plus IL‑12\nTelomerase plays a pivotal role in tumor cell prolifera-\ntion. The telomerase complex is essential for maintaining"}, {"page_number": 16, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\n64 \nPage 16 of 28\ntelomere length at chromosome ends during DNA replica-\ntion. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a \ncatalyst within the telomerase complex, is highly expressed \nin tumors and promotes tumor growth by facilitating cell \nproliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and \nother pathways. Consequently, hTERT becomes a valuable \nanti-tumor target.\nIn a phase I trial evaluating the safety of DNA vaccines \ntargeting hTERT in solid tumor patients, 34 pancreatic can-\ncer patients who exhibited no evidence of disease (NED) \nafter front-line therapy were enrolled in two groups. These \ngroups received modified plasmid DNA encoding hTERT \nvariants (INO-1400/INO-1401) alone or in combination \nwith an interleukin 12 plasmid (INO-9012). Both groups dis-\nplayed excellent tolerance. In terms of clinical activity, the \nmedian DFS was 9 months, with 41.4% of patients remain-\ning disease-free at 18 months. Additionally, the production \nof hTERT-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was observed \nin the remaining patients, which correlated with survival \nbenefits [150].\nRNA vaccine plus anti‑PD‑1 plus chemotherapy\nRNA vaccines have garnered significant anticipation in \nrecent years due to their relatively simple production pro-\ncess, high efficiency, and accuracy. A recent phase I clini-\ncal trial illuminated the potential application of neoantigen \nRNA vaccines in treating patients with surgically resected \npancreatic cancer. In this clinical trial, Luis A. Rojas et al. \nsequentially administered atezolizumab, autologous neo-\nantigen-specific RNA vaccine, and mFOLFIRINOX to \npatients, observing favorable tolerability with only one out \nof 16 patients experiencing grade 3 AEs. Additionally, the \nvaccine demonstrated the ability to induce high-intensity \npolyclonal neoantigen-specific T cell responses in 50% of \npatients, resulting in a longer median recurrence-free sur-\nvival compared to non-responders (non-responders: 13.4 \nmonths vs. responders: not reached) at an 18-month median \nfollow-up. This exciting outcome is evidently contingent on \nthe presence of tumors [151]. The safety and effectiveness \nof this vaccine in pancreatic cancer patients await validation \nthrough larger-scale clinical trials. Nevertheless, this clinical \ntrial underscores the feasibility of an mRNA-based neoanti-\ngen vaccine for treating pancreatic cancer [152].\nMost of the vaccines evaluated in current clinical experi-\nments have demonstrated good safety and tolerance. Rel-\nevant clinical data have shown certain immunological \nchanges and clinical activity, resulting in varying degrees \nof disease remission. These effects are primarily reflected \nin the proportion of patients achieving stable disease and \nimprovements in PFS. However, the impact on OS remains \nlimited. To provide more reliable treatment options, it may \nbe necessary to explore more diverse and precise directions.\nAdoptive cell transfer therapy\nAdoptive cell therapy harnesses the body's own cells to \nenhance cellular resistance and eliminate rejection by re-\nengineering them. T cells, the cornerstone of immunother-\napy, are extracted from the patient's body and genetically \nmodified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), \nenabling them to mount a more potent and sustained \nresponse. These engineered T cells circulate within the \nbody, delivering precise and efficient anti-tumor capabili-\nties [153] (Fig. 1). While adoptive cell therapy has dem-\nonstrated remarkable clinical benefits in hematological \nmalignancies [154], its effectiveness in solid tumors, with \ntheir complex tumor microenvironments, presents a chal-\nlenge in predicting outcomes.\nCD133, a transmembrane protein highly expressed in \nvarious solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer, emerges \nas a potential immunotherapy target for patients with \nadvanced CD133-positive tumors [155]. Wang Y et al. \ninvestigated the efficacy of CD133-directed CAR-T cells \nin patients with advanced metastatic malignancies. Results \nfrom 23 patients, including 14 with hepatocellular carci-\nnomas and seven with pancreatic carcinomas, showed that \nthree achieved partial remission, and 14 achieved stable \ndisease. The median PFS was 5 months, with the main \nobserved toxicity being a decrease in hemoglobin/plate-\nlet counts [156]. Given the immunosuppressive nature of \nintrahepatic and pancreatic cancers, this regimen holds \npromise for pancreatic cancer patients.\nMesothelin, highly expressed in pancreatic cancer \ncells, represents a target for multiple immunotherapy \napproaches. In one phase I trial, engineered T cells were \ndesigned to transiently express a CAR specific for meso-\nthelin. These cells were administered to six patients with \nchemotherapy-refractory metastatic PDAC. Of these \npatients, two achieved stable disease, with PFS ranging \nfrom 3.8 to 5.4 months. Monitoring of metabolic active \nvolume (MAV) in individual tumor lesions revealed sta-\nbility in three patients and a 69.2% decrease in MAV in \none patient with confirmed mesothelin expression [157].\nThe authors also employed a lentiviral CAR-expres-\nsion system to stably express CART-meso in T cells. \nThis phase I trial included patients with malignant \npleural mesothelioma (MPM), ovarian adenocarcinoma \n(OVCA), and PDAC. Results indicated that 11 of 15 \npatients achieved stable disease, with peak CART-meso \ncell numbers detected in peripheral blood at 6–14 days, \nalthough they persisted only transiently. Pre-treatment \nwith cyclophosphamide enhanced CART-meso expansion \nbut did not prolong persistence beyond 28 days. Addi-\ntionally, CART-meso DNA was detected in 70% (seven of \n10) tumor biopsies, and human anti-chimeric antibodies"}, {"page_number": 17, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\t\nPage 17 of 28 \n64\n(HACA) were detected in the blood of 57.1% (eight of 14) \npatients. The limited clinical activity may be attributed to \nlow mesothelin expression in the patient population. Over-\nall, CART-meso cells demonstrated good tolerability and \nexpansion in the blood of all patients but yielded limited \nclinical activity [158]. Furthermore, clinical trials evalu-\nating mesothelin-specific CARs containing fully human \nscFv (NCT03054298 and NCT03323944) are ongoing \nto address concerns about murine scFv-induced immune \nclearance of CAR-T cells.\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a \ncell surface receptor highly expressed by tumor cells, has \nbecome a target for CAR-T cell therapy. In a phase I trial \nconducted by Feng KC et al., HER2-targeting CAR-T cells \nwere administered to patients with advanced unresectable \npancreatic cancer following pre-treatment with nab-pacli-\ntaxel and cyclophosphamide. The results demonstrated that \ntwo pancreatic cancer patients achieved stable disease, with \nPFS durations of 5.3 and 8.3 months, respectively. Notably, \nthis data compare favorably to an overall median PFS of 4.8 \nmonths (range, 1.5–8.3 months) in the same group, suggest-\ning that HER2-targeted CAR-T therapy may benefit specific \npancreatic cancer patient populations [159].\nSimilarly, in another phase I trial [160], 16 patients with \nEGFR-positive metastatic pancreatic cancer underwent \ncyclophosphamide preconditioning followed by CART-\nEGFR cell therapy. Fourteen evaluable patients achieved \npartial responses lasting 2–4 months, and eight patients \nexperienced stable disease. The median OS for all 14 eval-\nuable patients was 4.9 months, with a median PFS of 3 \nmonths from the start of treatment. Notably, the occurrence \nof grade ≥ 3 adverse events, such as fever/fatigue, nausea/\nvomiting, and mucous membrane/skin toxicity, significantly \nimproved after treatment. Overall, while the results were not \nideal, they were encouraging.\nSimilarly encouraging efficacy was observed in seven \nlocally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer patients \nwith adoptive anti-CD3 x anti-EGFR bispecific antibody \narmed activated T cells (BATs). In this phase I/II clinical \ntrial, seven patients with PC survived more than a year, \nincluding one who was still alive at 54 months. The median \nOS was 31 months, and two patients notably achieved CR \nafter restarting chemotherapy [161]. In conclusion, BATs \ninfusion is considered safe and may improve survival in \npatients with pancreatic cancer by inducing an adaptive anti-\ntumor immune response.\nDespite the promise of adoptive cell transfer therapy, \nlimited clinical trials exist due to the high cost and time-\nconsuming nature of this approach (Table 1). Industrial pro-\nduction of off-the-shelf, universal CAR-T cells for patient \ntreatment holds the potential to make this therapy more \naccessible. Additionally, improving the efficacy of this \ntherapy in solid tumors will require further exploration. For \npancreatic cancer, the challenges of antigen selection and \nthe immunosuppressive microenvironment persist. However, \nmonotherapy regimens continue to demonstrate clinical \nactivity. Furthermore, cell therapies utilizing other immune \neffector cells such as NK cells and macrophages as carriers \nfor CARs have shown promise in preclinical and clinical \nexperiments [162, 163].\nConclusion and discussion\nIt is evident that regardless of the chosen treatment modal-\nity, single-mechanism-based immunotherapy strategies face \nsignificant challenges in altering the grim prognosis of pan-\ncreatic cancer patients. Combining various immunotherapy \napproaches with conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, \nmolecular targeted therapy, and other diverse treatment \nmodalities has exhibited a more expansive realm of develop-\nment and heightened therapeutic potential in clinical trials. \nThis inclination is closely tied to the inherent attributes of \nPC itself.\nThe complex immunosuppressive microenvironment \nintrinsic to PC, compounded by the physical barriers erected \nby fibroproliferative stroma, and the distinctive immuno-\nlogical traits characterized by low TMB collectively exert \na profound influence on pancreatic cancer's onset and pro-\ngression. These factors impact multiple facets of the body's \nimmune response against tumor cells. Strategies for future \npancreatic cancer treatment must focus on mitigating or \nreversing these adversarial effects through comprehensive \nsystemic treatment regimens.\nSpecifically, this involves deploying technical innovations \nsuch as constructing carrier systems to enhance drug deliv-\nery to tumor sites, breaching physical barriers, and conduct-\ning in-depth research into the complex pancreatic cancer \ntumor microenvironment to modify its immunosuppressive \nattributes. By doing so, we can unleash the full potential of \nanti-tumor immune cells like effector T cells, boosting their \ncapacity to recognize and eliminate tumor cells.\nPancreatic cancer's low tumor mutational burden sets it \napart from other solid tumors, resulting in fewer neoanti-\ngens, limited immune activation, and restricted options \nfor targeting tumor cells. Additionally, tumor cell hetero-\ngeneity and the rarity of identical neoantigens across dif-\nferent individuals make it challenging to mount effective \nimmunotherapies that target a single or a small number of \nneoantigens. These unique features and constraints make \npancreatic cancer appear daunting to treat. However, a judi-\ncious combination of therapeutic strategies will undoubtedly \nenhance patient prognoses, paving the way for precise and \npersonalized immunotherapy programs within the context \nof comprehensive treatment strategies."}, {"page_number": 18, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\n64 \nPage 18 of 28\nThe status and abundance of immune cells in the TME \nvary among different cancer types [164]. Considering \nthe influence of the complex and unique tumor microen-\nvironment of PDAC on immunotherapy and the diverse \nresponses of different populations to tumor cells, further \nresearch on neoantigen vaccines is crucial to achieve per-\nsonalized precision treatment strategies. Deepening our \nunderstanding of the correlation between different compo-\nnents in the TME of pancreatic cancer is essential. Adopt-\ning appropriate treatment plans tailored to patients with \ndistinct TME characteristics or immune profiles is integral \nto personalized immunotherapy against pancreatic cancer.\nData from single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that, \ndespite heterogeneity, immunosuppressive myeloid and \nmacrophage populations predominate in the PDAC TME, \nwith prevalent expression of immune checkpoints on dys-\nfunctional T cells and NK cells [165]. Within the TME, \nthe interactions of immune cells with other components \nsuch as the cellular matrix are complex. H. Sadozai et al. \nanalyzed the composition of pancreatic cancer stroma and \ninfiltrating immune cells, finding that immune cells may \ninfluence the PFS of patients with surgical resection of \npancreatic cancer by altering the composition of pancre-\natic stroma. Levels of CD3 and CD206 can serve as prog-\nnostic indicators of PFS [166]. Another study also identi-\nfied that long-term survivors (LTS) of PDAC exhibited \nhigher infiltration levels of immune cells, particularly T \ncells, and positivity for TLS in the TME. Stromal iNOS \ncells and CD68 cells were considered to have greater prog-\nnostic value [167].\nM. Wartenberg et al. integrated data on immune cell \nbackground and histological characteristics of patients with \npancreatic cancer, identifying three subtypes with differ-\nent immunological characteristics and prognosis: \"immune \nescape,\" “immune enrichment,” and \"immune exhausted.\" \nApproximately 35% of patients belong to the \"immune \nenrichment” subtype, characterized by T cell enrichment, \nlower levels of FOXP3 + Tregs, and mutations in CDKN2A \nand PIK3CA, indicating a poorer prognosis [168].\nSimilarly, an analysis based on transcriptomic signatures \nof immune infiltration categorized PDAC into adaptive, \ninnate, and immune-exclusion subtypes. Innate immune sub-\ntypes associated with poorer survival exhibited an enrich-\nment of NK cells and neutrophils and an exclusion of other \ntumor-infiltrated lymphocytes. This suggests that therapies \ntargeting NK cells and neutrophils may yield better thera-\npeutic outcomes in these patients. The “T cell dominant” \nsubtype, being the most immunogenic, demonstrated enrich-\nment of adaptive immune-associated subsets, making it \nmore suitable for immune checkpoint-related therapies. The \n“tumor dominant\" subtype, characterized by low immune \ncell infiltration in the TME, indicates prominent metabolic \nadaptation [169].\nThe crosstalk between different components of the TME \nand immune cells is intricate. Identifying immunosensi-\ntive or drug-resistant patients through the analysis of tumor \ninterstitial and immune backgrounds is crucial for predict-\ning treatment responses [170]. Simultaneously, for patients \nwho are not candidates for surgical removal, this approach \nis challenging but equally indispensable. In any case, pro-\nmoting the infiltration of local anti-tumor immune cells and \nreversing the adverse effects of the tumor microenvironment \non these cells are imperative to overcome the heterogeneous \nTME of pancreatic cancer.\nPresently, several studies have identified immunosuppres-\nsive factors in pancreatic cancer that originate with gene \nmutations and intensify as tumors progress, ultimately cul-\nminating in the establishment of advanced local immune \nprivilege. Preventing and detecting tumors early have always \nbeen paramount, particularly for diseases like pancreatic \ncancer that lack early symptoms and effective screening \nmethods. Therefore, devising effective early screening strate-\ngies and corresponding interventions is of paramount impor-\ntance. Furthermore, stratifying pancreatic cancer patients \nbased on distinct genetic, pathological, and other attributes \nto tailor personalized treatments is another avenue worthy \nof exploration. Researchers have categorized patients into \nimmune escape phenotypes, enrichment phenotypes, and \nexhaustion phenotypes based on molecular characteristics \nand prognosis, underscoring the inaccuracy of a one-size-\nfits-all treatment approach. Swift patient stratification via \nreliable early stage biomarkers and the selection of suitable \nindividualized combination therapies may constitute a reli-\nable future treatment option, albeit a challenging one.\nIn conjunction with several preclinical studies, we have \nobserved consistent efficacy of oncolytic viruses against \npancreatic cancer [171]. Additionally, targeting immune \nactivation markers such as OX40 [172], CD40 [173], and \n4-1BB [174], in combination with immunotherapy, consist-\nently demonstrates potential therapeutic value. Moreover, an \nanticipated research direction involves enhancing the impact \nof immunotherapy by altering the pancreatic cancer TME \nwith low immune invasion through matrix destruction or tar-\ngeted interventions [175–177]. TLS, identified not only as a \nprognostic indicator of immunotherapy but also as inducible \nby immunotherapy under specific conditions, becomes an \nimmune element in the anti-tumor immune response within \ntumors [178]. Given that the generation of TLS is invariably \nassociated with the presence of high endothelial venules, the \ncontinual generation and maintenance of TLS at the tumor \nsite can overcome the solid stromal barriers of pancreatic \ncancer, facilitating extensive immune cell infiltration and \nsustained anti-tumor immune responses.\nRecent studies have illuminated the influence of the \ngut microbiome and its metabolites on the immune sys-\ntem in patients with pancreatic cancer [179]. Specifically,"}, {"page_number": 19, "text": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2024) 73:64\t\nPage 19 of 28 \n64\nsachharopolyspora, pseudoxanthomonas, and streptomyces \nare significantly enriched in patients with long-term sur-\nvival (LTS), promoting the recruitment and activation of T \ncells at the tumor site [180]. Beyond influencing the adap-\ntive immune response, the gut microbiota can contribute to \nthe progression of PDAC by regulating the innate immune \nsystem, particularly by inhibiting the infiltration and acti-\nvation of NK cells [181]. A more profound understanding \nof the crosstalk between distinct intestinal environments \nand PDAC immune microenvironments may constitute a \nmeans to achieve personalized immunotherapy.\nSimultaneously, the limitations of mouse models in \npancreatic cancer research have become increasingly \napparent. This underscores the imperative for more refined \npancreatic cancer research models, emphasizing the dis-\nparities in experimental outcomes stemming from differ-\nences between human and mouse models. Exploring these \ndistinctions holds the potential to deepen our comprehen-\nsion of tumor immune mechanisms in pancreatic cancer.\nCurrent clinical treatment and scientific investigation \nof pancreatic cancer face substantial hurdles. Overcom-\ning these obstacles necessitates numerous endeavors and \ncollaborations between researchers and clinicians.

Dysregulation of miRNA expres-\nsion and function has been linked to a variety of diseases including cancer. They play a complex role in cancers, having both \ntumour suppressor and promoter properties. In addition, a single miRNA can be involved in regulating several mRNAs or \nmany miRNAs can regulate a single mRNA, therefore assessing these roles is essential to a better understanding in cancer \ninitiation and development. Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, in part due to the lack of diag-\nnostic tools and limited treatment options. The most common form of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma \n(PDAC), is characterised by major genetic mutations that drive cancer initiation and progression. The regulation or interaction \nof miRNAs with these cancer driving mutations suggests a strong link between the two. Understanding this link between \nmiRNA and PDAC progression may give rise to novel treatments or diagnostic tools. This review summarises the role of \nmiRNAs in PDAC, the downstream signalling pathways that they play a role in, how these are being used and studied as \ntherapeutic targets as well as prognostic/diagnostic tools to improve the clinical outcome of PDAC.\nKeywords  microRNA · Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma · Novel therapeutics · Diagnostics\nIntroduction\nMicroRNA (miRNA) are small RNA molecules that play \na crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to \nmessenger RNAs (mRNA), thereby influencing protein pro-\nduction and downstream cellular function. In cancer, dys-\nregulation of miRNAs is frequently observed, contributing \nto disease progression, making them important biomarkers \nand potential therapeutic targets in cancer research and treat-\nment. In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma \n(PDAC), there is an increased in effort to study and reveal \nspecific alterations in miRNA expression patterns and how \nthey have contributed to the disease. Here, we shed light on \nthe pivotal role of miRNAs in the development and progres-\nsion of this difficult-to-treat cancer.\nmicroRNAs and their function\nMicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that are \nknown to play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expres-\nsion in eukaryotic cells. They are typically between 21 and \n25 nucleotides in length and have been shown to post-tran-\nscriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to mRNA \nmolecules. This binding occurs mainly at the 3' untranslated \nregion (3’UTR) of the target mRNA where their binding \ncan prevent protein translation or trigger the degradation of \ntarget mRNAs.\nThrough controlling the expression of specific genes, \nmiRNAs play critical roles in a wide range of biological \nprocesses, including development, cell differentiation, apop-\ntosis and response to environmental changes and stress. Dys-\nregulation of miRNA expression or function has been linked \nto various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative \ndisorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders.\nThe miRNA field has significantly grown in recent \nyears leading to mounting evidence of their biological \n *\t Jessica L.

When the first miRNA, lin-4, was discovered \nin Caenorhabditis elegans in 1993, it was characterised as \na gene responsible for regulating worm development. It was \nlater discovered that lin-4 was able to bind to the 3’UTR of \nanother gene named lin-14 and led to a post-transcriptional \ndownregulation of lin-14, therefore lin-4 was not a typical \ngene but a non-coding RNA responsible for the regulation \nof target genes [1]. Several years later, the second miRNA \nlet-7 was discovered and more excitingly, let-7 was found \nto be conserved across species including humans [2]. As \nthe field expanded so did the discovery of more small non-\ncoding RNAs, now known as miRNAs. To date, there are \n1,917 human miRNAs recorded in the miRNA database, \nmiRBase [3].\nSince the discovery of lin-14, it is now well established \nthat miRNAs can bind to the 3’UTR of mRNAs and cause \nmRNA degradation (complementary sequency) or transla-\ntion inhibition (imperfectly complementary) (Fig. 1). Micro-\nRNAs are mostly generated through the canonical pathway \nalthough some are generated through non-canonical path-\nways [4–6]. In the canonical pathway, a miRNA gene is \ntranscribed by RNA polymerase II and further cleaved by \nmicroprocessors such as Drosha and DiGeorge Syndrome \nCritical Region 8 (DGCR8) within the nucleus to form a \nprecursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). After exiting the nucleus \nby the help of nuclear protein Exportin 5, pre-miRNA is \nthen processed by a ribonuclease called Dicer and results \nin a mature miRNA duplex. In order for miRNAs to bind \nto mRNA for gene silencing, Dicer is responsible of cleav-\ning the miRNA duplex into two strands and one of them, \nreferred as the guide strand, forms a miRNA-induced silenc-\ning complex (miRISC) by attaching onto Argonaute (AGO), \nwhich then guides the binding of the miRISC to the target \nmRNA sequence. The leftover strand is commonly named \nthe passenger strand which is then degraded. Depending \non which strand from the duplex is selected, either running \nfrom the 5’ side or the 3’ side, the miRNA is named with \nthe notation ‘-5p’ or ‘-3p’ respectively. In some cases, both \nstrands go on to form miRISCs, although studies have found \nthat some -5p and -3p miRNAs exist in different abundances \nand regulate different mRNA targets, resulting in sometimes \nopposing physiological effects.\nSome miRNAs are generated via a number of non-canon-\nical pathways, one example is the primary miRNAs (pri-\nmiRNAs) transcribed from the miRtrons (located within the \nintron region of protein coding genes) that cannot be cropped \nby Drosha and DGCR8 [4, 6]. Instead, these undergo a splic-\ning process by debranching enzyme 1 (DBR1) which results \nin a shorter sequence. By studying the changes in mRNA \nexpression in miRNA-transfected cells using microarray \napproaches, researchers have shown that multiple miRNAs \ncan target the same mRNA, and one miRNA can regulate \nhundreds of targets, which directly affects the amount of \nproteins translated [7–11]. Therefore, many believe that \nmiRNAs play a pivotal role in regulating numerous cellular \nprocesses resulting in significant physiological changes.\nmiRNAs in cancer\nWhile plenty of studies have demonstrated the role of over-\nexpressed/suppressed expression of miRNAs in diseases \nsuch as cardiovascular diseases, autoimmunity and neu-\nrodegenerative disorders, cancer was the first disease ever \nproven to involve miRNAs during pathogenesis [12]. In \n2002, Calin and colleagues discovered that both miR-15 and \nmiR-16 genes are located on the frequently deleted chromo-\nsomal region in chronic B cell lymphocytic leukaemia [13]. \nThey later found that both miR-15a and miR-16–1 directly \ndownregulate BCL-2 expression and induce apoptosis [14]. \nWith the advancement of miRNA profiling, not only has it \nbeen revealed that human miRNAs are frequently located \nat genomic sites that commonly exhibit DNA copy number \nabnormalities, and are consequently highly associated with \ncancer development, but it was also discovered that miRNA-\nassociated genes such as Dicer1 and Agonaute2 have copy \nnumber alterations in several cancers including ovarian can-\ncer [15–17]. A more recent study utilised previously gener-\nated whole genome sequencing datasets from The Cancer \nGenome Atlas (TCGA), and computational analysis to show \nthat significantly over-mutated miRNA genes were com-\nmonly found across 33 different cancer types and associated \nwith patient survival and cancer staging [18].\nSince then, studies have discovered dysregulated \nmiRNAs in almost all types of cancers, whether overex-\npressed or suppressed. These altered miRNA expressions \nare classified as either oncogenic (oncomiRs) or tumour \nsuppressive miRNAs based on the affected downstream \nsignalling pathways and the overall effect on disease pro-\ngression. Examples of oncomiRs include miR-23b and \nmiR-27b which both promote breast cancer cell prolif-\neration and migration in vitro [19]. Implanting mice with \nbreast cancer cells that had CRISPR-knockout of both \nmiRNAs led to significantly reduced tumour volume \nand improved overall survival indicating an oncogenic \nrole for both miR-23b and miR-27b in breast cancer. On \nthe other hand, another study in which mice received \nxenograft transplantation of liver cancer cells that were \ntransfected with miR-212-5p mimics, were later found to \nhave significantly smaller tumours compared to control \n[20]. This was through decreased cancer cell prolifera-\ntion and increased apoptosis via directly inhibiting the \nsuppressor of cytokine signalling 5 (SOCS5). Interest-\ningly, miRNAs can act as both tumour promoter and sup-\npresser in different types of cancers.

Recent estimates by GLOBOCAN suggested \nthat 495,773 patients globally were diagnosed with pan-\ncreatic cancer in 2020 and another 466,000 patients died \nas a result of pancreatic cancer [23]. Despite pancreatic \ncancer being ranked 13th in incidence amongst other can-\ncer types, pancreatic cancer is projected to become the 2nd \nand 3rd leading cause of cancer-associated death in the \nUnited States and Europe respectively by 2030 [24, 25]. \nOver 90% cases of pancreatic malignancies are classified \nas PDAC, characterised by poor prognosis and survival. \nVague clinical symptoms and late presentation result in \nover 80% of patients having metastatic disease at time of \ndiagnosis. Once disseminated, surgical resection of the \nprimary tumour is not usually recommended, and patients \nprimarily rely on chemotherapy as a systematic treatment \nfor prolonged survival.\nSince the first study associated miRNAs with cancer \ndevelopment, investigating the role of miRNAs in different \ncancers has become an emerging area of research. In fact, \nincreasing evidence continues to identify new miRNAs \nthat are directly involved in driving the progression of \nPDAC [26]. In addition, extracellular miRNAs have been \nfound to be transported in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that \ncan reprogram both proximally and distally located cells. \nThese EVs can be found present in a range of bodily fluids, \ndue to their high stability, making them an excellent candi-\ndate biomarker for disease diagnosis, prognosis and even \nindication of treatment response. Studying the importance \nof miRNAs in PDAC will likely yield novel insights into \nthe disease that cannot be uncovered by solely investigat-\ning individual proteins or pathways.\nDysregulated miRNAs in pancreatic cancer\nMicroRNAs are found to be dysregulated in cancer due to \nalterations on the biogenesis of miRNA in different stages, \nincluding modifications in chromosomes, epigenetics, \ntranscriptional and microprocessor activity on pri-miRNA/\npre-miRNA production, miRISC activity and interactions \nbetween miRNAs and other non-coding RNAs (Fig. 1). \nIn the last decades, many studies have attempted to cata-\nlogue all of the dysregulated miRNAs in PDAC primary \ntumours, pancreatic juice [27] and blood [28–30] which \nwill likely identify new miRNA and downstream path-\nway targets that can be exploited as novel treatments or \ndiagnostic tools. We have summarised some examples of \nupregulated and downregulated miRNAs recently (within \nthe last 5 years) discovered in human PDAC tumours, \ncompared to adjacent normal pancreatic tissue, that were \nidentified using miRNA sequencing/microarray (Tables 1 \nand 2).\nTo date, studies have commonly utilised publicly avail-\nable software/databases such as TargetScan, miRbase, \nmiRDB and miRTarBase to predict which mRNAs that a \nspecific miRNA is likely to bind to based on their nucleotide \nsequences [31]. These are then typically verified experimen-\ntally by conducting a luciferase based-reporter assay which \nmeasures the binding activity between the 3’UTR of the \ntarget mRNA and the miRNA, compared to a mutated con-\ntrol. Functional assays are then performed to examine the \nbiological relevance of miRNA expression on cell prolifera-\ntion, migration, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo \nusing cell lines and/or murine implantations.\nGenetic alterations and the interplay \nwith miRNAs in PDAC initiation \nand progression\nMany risk factors are associated with the development of \nPDAC and one of the biggest contributors to the initiation of \nPDAC is genetic alterations [69]. Although it varies between \npatients, the carcinogenesis of PDAC is a highly multifac-\neted process that involves the interplay of many molecular, \ncellular, and acellular elements. The development of full-\nblown PDAC is preceded by three stages of morphologi-\ncally distinct intraepithelial lesions (PanIN) that arise from \nnormal pancreatic acinar cells. Major genetic mutations that \nare found across different stages of PanIN include KRAS \nmutations in the early stage of PanIN-1, loss of CDKN2A \nacross PanIN-1 to PanIN-3, loss of SMAD4 and TP53 in \nPanIN-3 leading to PDAC [70] (Fig. 2).\nIn recent years, several miRNAs have been demon-\nstrated to directly regulate and/or interact with these com-\nmonly mutated genes which suggests a strong link between \nmiRNA and PDAC initiation and progression [58, 71]. For \nexample, miR-193b levels are reduced in PDAC and in the \nearly epithelial changes around the tumour tissue as com-\npared to adjacent normal tissue [72]. Furthermore, both \nmiR-193b and miR-143-3p can directly regulate KRAS, \nwhich promoted cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo [58, \n71]. Further evidence indicates that the absence of miR-802 \nin both the KC (Ptf1aCre/+ KrasG12D/+) and KPC (Ptf1a-\nCre/+ KrasG12D/+ P53R172H/+) mouse model led to a striking \nincrease in acinar-to-ductal lesions in mouse models, but \nshowed an insignificant effect on human PDAC cancer cell \nproliferation, indicting miR-802 may be particularly funda-\nmental in regulating the initiation of PDAC [73].\nIn addition, dysregulated miRNA expression, medi-\nated through epigenetic changes and changes in miRNA"}, {"page_number": 5, "text": "167\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\t\nbiogenesis, can subsequently result in altered mRNA \nexpression of oncogenes [74]. One of the key enzymes in \nthe biogenesis of miRNAs is Dicer. A recent study uncov-\nered Dicer expression is not only upregulated in advanced \nPDAC tissue, but it also controls metabolic changes in \ncancer cells that promote cell growth and resistance to \ngemcitabine chemotherapy [75].\nTo further demonstrate the role of miRNAs in PDAC \ndevelopment, multiple studies have shown certain cancer-\nassociated miRNAs are differentially expressed throughout \nmalignant progression. Utilising immunohistochemistry \ncoupled with in situ hybridisation, miR-143 expression \nlevels were found to decrease over the stages of PanIN 2, \n3 and PDAC [76]. Functional studies verified that higher \nexpression of miR-143 suppressed cancer cell prolifera-\ntion and invasion in vitro via directly regulating mucin 13 \n(MUC13). Another study from Hirabayashi et al. identified \nthat miR-4653-3p is progressively increased from early \nto late PanIN and PDAC, and not expressed in normal \npancreatic tissue [77], HIPK2 was found to be a direct \ntarget of miR-4653 and its pattern of expression is inverse \nto miR-4653. Since HIPK2 has been previously reported \nto regulate the tumour suppressor gene p53, it is hypoth-\nesised that increased miR-4653 in later stages of PDAC \nsuppresses the expression of HIPK2 thereby contributing \nto poor prognosis.\nDespite the evidence of dysregulated miRNAs in modu-\nlating mRNA expression, it is noteworthy that miRNAs are \nnot always the initiator of these changes. miRNAs can be \nmodulated by other endogenous non-coding RNAs such as \nlong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and circular RNA (cir-\ncRNA) which also affect cancer progression at a post-tran-\nscriptional level. Increasing evidence indicates that these \nother non-coding RNAs compete to bind to miRNAs and act \nas a ‘sponge’ to inhibit the downstream mRNA regulatory \nactivity [78, 79].\nmiRNA effects on cell proliferation and cell \ncycle progression\nDownstream of oncogenic KRAS are two key signalling \npathways; the MAPK/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt cascades; \nwhich are critical to cell proliferation, cell cycle progression \nand survival [80]. Several miRNAs have been suggested to \nregulate the expression of oncogenes or tumour suppress-\ning genes which ultimately either positively or negatively \ncontribute towards tumour development [81].

Similarly, \ndownregulated expression of miR-98-5p was shown to lead \nto upregulated MAP4K4 which promoted cell proliferation, \ninvasion, and migration of PDAC cells in vitro by promoting \nMAPK/ERK signalling [56].\nIn another study, miR-21 was found to stimulate the EGF \npathway through binding to the sprouty RTK signalling \nantagonist 2 (Spry2), resulting in increased cell prolifera-\ntion and activation of downstream MAPK/ERK and PI3K/\nAkt signalling pathways [33]. Many miRNAs can have mul-\ntiple mRNA targets, one example being miR-24-3p, which \ncan target both Laminin Subunit Beta 3 (LAMB3) and anti-\nsilencing function 1B (ASF1B), contributing to the aggres-\nsive nature of PDAC by activating PI3K/Akt pathway and \ntriggering EMT respectively [45, 46]. In 2021, two separate \ngroups found that low miR-30d expression is associated \nwith poor prognosis in PDAC, and that this miRNA can \ntarget RUNX1 and SOX4 to promote cancer cell malignancy \n[53, 54].

Cancer cells can generate large amounts \nof energy through increased uptake and metabolism of \nglucose via anaerobic rather than aerobic glycolysis, \neven under normoxia (termed the 'Warburg effect') [70]. \nMetabolism is critical to cell proliferation, migration, \nand survival, and in PDAC, the Warburg effect has been \nlinked to increased resistance to chemotherapy [83]. \nMicroRNAs have been implicated in various facets of \ncancer cell metabolism. For example, miR-3662 has been \nshown to decrease the Warburg effect by targeting glyco-\nlytic genes including glucose transporter: solute carrier \nfamily 2 member 1 (SLC2A1) and glycolytic enzymes: \nphosphofructokinase platelet (PFKP), pyruvate kinase M \n(PKM) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) [68].\nFurthermore, in a gemcitabine-resistant murine xeno-\ngraft model, it was demonstrated that overexpression of \nmiR-3662 could re-sensitise the tumour to gemcitabine, \nresulting in reduced tumour growth via directly reduc-\ning levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), which is \nknown to promote glycolysis in cancer [83]. Meanwhile, \nanother study has shown miR-124 regulates monocar-\nboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), a downstream target of \nHIF-1α [84]. Inhibiting lactate transporting MCT1 results \nin changes in cell acidity and inhibits cancer cell prolifera-\ntion and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Although increasing \nnumber of studies have been performed in recent decades \nto explore the role of miRNA in a range of cancers, limited \nresearch has been conducted in PDAC. Considering the \nimportance of cancer metabolism, further research should \nbe performed which may shed light into novel therapeutic \ninterventions targeting the aberrant metabolic pathway.\nFig. 3   Examples of miRNAs involved in PDAC progression"}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "171\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\t\nmiRNAs in epithelial mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT) and hypoxia\nThe term EMT refers to the process by which cancer cells \nwith an epithelial phenotype adopt a more mesenchymal \nphenotype, which is known to associate with their ability \nto invade, migrate and even become resistance to chem-\notherapy-induced cell death. EMT-associated genes have \nalso been highly related to disease prognosis, and stud-\nies have uncovered several miRNAs that are thought to \ndirectly regulate EMT genes. The miR-200 family (miR-\n200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-124, miR-429) well-\nknown for its ability to maintain a cancer cell epithelial \nstatus and prevent EMT. For example, miR-200b and miR-\n200c expression has been correlated with the formation \nof tumour budding, a classic EMT feature. Although their \nexpression levels vary between studies, the miR-200 fam-\nily is typically upregulated in PDAC tumours compared to \nmatched normal pancreas. Upregulation of miR-200 family \nmembers typically results in a suppression of the EMT-\ninducing zinc finger E-Box-Binding homeobox (ZEB) \nfamily. This in turn releases the ZEB repression of E-cad-\nherin expression. E-cadherin is a key cadherin subtype \nassociated with the maintenance of an epithelial phenotype \n[85–87]. This effect has been confirmed in cells that were \ninduced to undergo TGF-β-mediated EMT, where there \nwas a significant decrease in miR-200 family expression, \nwhich was accompanied by a gain in expression mesenchy-\nmal markers such as ZEB [88]. The association of these \nmiRNAs with EMT markers have been further confirmed \nin a set of PDAC tumour tissues and sera [89]. A recent \nstudy by Huang et al. (2023) indicated that miR-24-3p \ndirectly targets ASF1B to subsequently promote an EMT \nphenotype in cancer cells resulting in enhanced invasive-\nness in vitro [46]. Additionally, overexpression of miR-\n24-3p using miRNA mimics significantly reduced cancer \ncell growth although further in vivo studies are required \nto further investigate miR-24-3p’s therapeutic potential.\nAnother salient feature of the tumour microenvironment \nis the limited oxygen supply, due to rapid depletion of \noxygen by proliferating cancer cells, and/or compressed/\nblocked or otherwise insufficient vasculature. Increases in \nhypoxia within the tumour microenvironment have been \nshown to drive the progression of EMT in PDAC [90]. \nOverexpression of miR-301a promotes the adoption of a \nmore mesenchymal phenotype and upregulation of HIF-1α \nin through directly targeting TP63 [91]. In an oxygen-defi-\ncient environment, PDAC cells were also shown to release \nmore exosomal miR-30b-5p which subsequently promotes \nangiogenesis by inhibiting gap junction protein (GJA1) \nin endothelial cells. Similar studies have shown that can-\ncer cells that produce more miR-210 in exosomes may \nalso promote EMT, increased cellular permeability and \nenhanced tumour vascularisation [92, 93].\nmiRNA regulation of extracellular matrix \n(ECM) remodelling and stromal cell \nbehaviour\nA key characteristic of PDAC is the extensive desmoplasia \nfound in and around the tumour. This desmoplastic response \nincreases over the course of PanIN and PDAC development, \ntypically causing a physical barrier to treatment as well as \nproviding a route for cancer cells to metastasise [94]. There-\nfore, increasing efforts are being made to understand and tar-\nget the stroma in PDAC, in combination with conventional, \nalready approved therapies to increase treatment efficacy.\nA key contributor to, and regulator of the ECM is the \ncancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which is responsi-\nble for producing a large proportion of ECM components. \nAs such CAFs and CAF-mediated matrix deposition and \nremodelling are often considered tumour promoting. In the \nrecent decade, some studies have suggested that cells in \nthe tumour microenvironment utilise EVs containing miR-\nNAs to communicate with other cells, and thereby influ-\nence their cellular phenotypes [95, 96]. In 2015, Pang and \ncolleagues were the first to demonstrate that PDAC cells \nmay promote the differentiation of CAFs/CAF-like cells \nfrom normal fibroblasts through the secretion of miR-155 \ncontaining EVs, which can directly bind to TP53INP1 [97]. \nThe conversion of CAFs was confirmed by measuring the \nprotein level of TP53INP1, the CAF markers α-SMA and \nfibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibroblasts that were \nco-cultured with PDAC cell lines or media containing PDAC \ncell-derived EVs. On the other hand, CAFs have also been \nshown to reciprocally influence cancer cells through miRNA \nsecretion. In this recent study, cancer cells co-cultured with \nCAF-derived EVs containing miR-331-3p promoted the pro-\nliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells in vitro, \npotentially via directly inhibiting Scavenger Receptor Class \nA Member 5 (SCARA5) [98]. Other previous studies have \ndemonstrated that suppressing SCARA5 expression resulted \nin accelerated tumour progression by activating FAK signal-\nling [99] as well as promoting Snail1-regulated EMT and \ncancer cell migration [100].\nMicroRNAs have also been shown to play a role in \nregulating the secretion of matrix and matrix modifying \ncomponents. Lui et al. reported earlier this year that dif-\nferentially expressed miRNAs in PDAC patients are highly \nassociated with ECM organisation and remodelling [81]. \nIn this study, serum miRNAs were sequenced and found to \nbe associated with important cancer-driven genes, such as \nKRAS, and other ECM-related genes such as matrix metal-\nloprotease 14 (MMP14), plasminogen activator urokinase"}, {"page_number": 10, "text": "172\n\t\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\n(PLAU) and tenascin C (TNC). Moreover, KRAS activa-\ntion was found to associated with the ablation of miR-29 \nexpression in PDAC, resulting in increased deposition of \nECM proteins by CAFs and the promotion of cancer cell \ncolony formation in vitro [101]. From the same miRNA fam-\nily, miR-29a has been shown to inhibit the transcription of \nlysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2), an important ECM enzyme \nthat is responsible for collagen crosslinking and promot-\ning EMT in PDAC [48]. Another study has demonstrated \nthe importance of miR-21 in early development of PDAC, \nspecifically in regulating CAF phenotype and function, as \nwell as modulating the phenotype of immune cell popula-\ntions within the tumour microenvironment. However in this \nwork, there were no significant effects on cancer cells which \nindicates that some miRNAs may play specific roles in only \ncertain cell types [102]. Nevertheless, there is currently a \nlack of understanding regarding miRNAs that specifically \nregulate the matrisome of PDAC. This is in part because \nmost miRNA sequencing results from PDAC tumours were \nperformed on bulk tumour pieces, and as such ignore the \nheterogeneity of the tumour ecosystem, making it difficult \nto assign specific miRNA profiles to the stromal proportion \nof the PDAC tumour. In future, further studies are needed \nto understand miRNA’s role specifically in regulating the \ndeposition, organisation and remodelling of the ECM.\nThe role of miRNA in pancreatic cancer \nmetastasis\nThe poor prognosis PDAC patients face is not only due to \ndifficulties in treating the primary tumour but also in treat-\ning disseminated cancer cells that have colonised other \norgans, such as the liver. Metastasis is a multi-step process \nthat involves a multitude of cell types, and an environment \nthat favours the establishment of secondary tumours (Fig. 4). \nCancer cells that successfully invade into the local tissue \nmicroenvironment surrounding primary tumours, and breach \nthe vascular basement membrane (intravasation), can then \nenter the circulation, and disseminate around the body. At \nFig. 4   miRNAs have been shown to be implicated in multiple steps of \nthe metastatic cascade in PDAC including: 1. Cancer cell migration \nand invasion at the primary tumour 2. Intravasation into the blood \nand lymphatic systems 3. Survival and transit in the circulation 4. \nExtravasation from the vessels and invasion at the secondary sites 5. \nColonisation and expansion at the secondary sites"}, {"page_number": 11, "text": "173\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\t\nsome point, usually within a secondary tissue, cancer cells \nthen extravasate (exit the circulation) and begin colonisation \nof the secondary site. At this stage they may also become \ndormant.\nDuring the initial stage of local invasion, miRNAs play \na role in aiding migration by promoting EMT [103, 104]. \nAn example miRNA in EMT promotion is miR-361-3p, that \ndirectly targets dual-specificity phosphatase–2 (DUSP2) to \nactivate ERK signalling pathway and promote EMT, result-\ning in increased cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro \n[38]. In vivo miR-361-3p overexpression results in an \nincreased number of metastatic nodules in the liver in mice.\nTumour vasculature is thought to provide a critical route \nof metastasis to secondary sites. It has been shown that \nunder oxygen-deficient conditions, pancreatic cancer cells \nproduce more EVs that are enriched for miR-30b-5p [34] \nthat trigger angiogenesis. Evidence in support of this was \ngained when endothelial cells transfected with miR-30b-5p \nmimics exhibited a higher total tube formation length and \nincreased in migration ability possibly through the miR-\n30b-5p inhibition of GJA1.\nTumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been \nassociated with promoting invasion and angiogenesis in \nsolid cancers, and previous evidence has demonstrated that \nmiRNA-containing vesicles can be produced by both TAMs \nand cancer cells to modulate each other’s tumour-promoting \nbehaviour. For example, hypoxic cancer cell-derived miR-\n301a induces a macrophage M2 polarisation via the PTEN/\nPI3Kγ pathway. Meanwhile, M2 polarised macrophages \nhave been shown to promote cancer cell EMT, invasion and \nmetastasis [105]. At the same time, M2 macrophages secrete \nmiR-501-3p that has been shown to promote cancer cells \ngrowth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo via inhibiting anti-\ntumourigenic TGF-β Receptor III (TGFBR3) [39].\nIn recent years, it has become evident that distant second-\nary sites may be primed in advance by tumours, in a process \nwhich was coined the pre-metastatic niche. There is clear \nevidence that cancer cells secrete miRNA-containing EVs \nas a form of cell-to-cell communication, and recent evidence \nhas also implicated these EVs in pre-conditioning metastatic \nsites in certain tumours [106, 107]. In addition, metastasis-\ning mesenchymal-like cancer cells have been observed to \nundergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and \nrevert to a more epithelial phenotype which is considered to \nbe beneficial for secondary site colonisation. As discussed \nabove, the miR-200 family has been well studied for their \nregulatory activity in promoting an epithelial phenotype \nthrough reducing the activities of ZEB1 and ZEB2 [86, \n108]. In particular overexpressed miR-429, a direct regula-\ntor of ZEB1, has been shown to  promote the adoption of an \nepithelial phenotype in cancer cells in secondary sites [86].\nTo date, there are no clinically approved drugs that spe-\ncifically target the metastasis process in cancer, despite \nmodern advancements in drug discovery. This is largely \ndue to the complexity of the metastatic cascade. Given the \nimportance of miRNA regulatory activities, the targeting \nof dysregulated miRNAs in metastasis could allow a com-\nbined effect on multiple tumour-promoting mRNAs. Fur-\nthermore, miRNAs can contribute to improve on our current \ndiagnostic and prognostic prediction. By quantifying circu-\nlating serum levels of miR-607 in a cohort of 184 PDAC \npatients, it was found that miR-607 was significantly cor-\nrelated with the presence of lymphatic and liver metastasis, \noverall survival, and progression-free survival, supporting \nmiRNA’s potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomark-\ners [29]. Therefore, monitoring the expression of cancer-\nassociated miRNAs involved in the various stages of the \nmetastatic cascade could potentially indicate disease pro-\ngression. Furthermore, novel therapeutic approaches could \nbe developed to target these miRNAs with either miRNA \nmimics/inhibitors to modulate key downstream signalling \npathways. For instance, miR-210 has been associated with \npancreatic cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis \nand in a cohort of PDAC mice, treatment with a miR-210 \ninhibitor demonstrated improved survival and reduced liver \nmetastasis compared to the control [109].\nmiRNAs and resistance to pancreatic cancer \ntreatment\nChemotherapy\nWith many patients presenting in the clinic with already dis-\nseminated disease that is surgically unresectable, systemic \nchemotherapy, sometimes in combination with radiother-\napy, remains the mainstay of treatment. The current recom-\nmended first-line therapy for PDAC is either FOLFIRINOX \n(a combination regimen of oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan \nand 5-fluorouracil) or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel [110]. \nHowever, the desmoplastic response in PDAC can create a \nphysical barrier for drug delivery, and in combination with \nother cellular factors can lead to the emergence of resistance. \nAcquired resistance often arises from a change at a genetic \nlevel (such as acquiring a new mutation), however changes \nin expression and/or activity of one transcriptional/transla-\ntional regulator may also lead to the emergence of resistance. \nOne such regulator has been shown to be miRNAs (Table 3).\nMany studies have suggested the role of miR-155 in \ndevelopment of PDAC chemoresistance [111, 112]. Not \nonly has it been shown that overexpression of miR-155 is \nassociated with worse prognosis, but evidence has also indi-\ncated that cancer cells secrete exosomal miR-155 to pass on \nthis resistant phenotype to neighbouring cells. Additionally, \nCAFs are also able to secrete exosomes to promote can-\ncer cell growth and resistance to chemotherapy, and most"}, {"page_number": 12, "text": "174\n\t\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\nsurprising was the discovery that gemcitabine can promote \nmiR-155 secretion from CAFs to create a positive feedback \nloop [113, 114]. Two studies in 2019 separately found that \noverexpression of the miR-30 family sensitises pancreatic \ncancer cells to gemcitabine through reducing two differ-\nent genes: snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1) \nand forkhead box D1 (FOXD1) [52, 115]. Other examples \ninclude the finding that abolished miR-1307 expression \nin pancreatic cancer cells led to an increase in DNA dam-\nage when exposed to FOLFIRINOX therapy [116]. As we \ndevelop a deeper understanding of the role that miRNAs \nplay in therapy resistance, we can utilise this information \nto target key miRNAs with miRNA mimics/inhibitors to \nsubsequently increase the efficacy of chemotherapy, as well \nas exploit them to monitor and even predict chemotherapy \nefficacy.\nRadiotherapy\nThe use of radiotherapy in PDAC also faces the challenge of \ndeveloping resistance. Radiation therapy induces DNA dam-\nage and miRNAs have been found to be modulate signalling \npathways that are crucial for cell cycle progression, DNA \ndamage repair and apoptosis [119, 120]. MicroRNAs that \nhave been associated with radiotherapy resistance in differ-\nent cancers have been well summarised in [121], including \nwork that has investigated the changes in miRNA expression \nin response to DNA damage caused by radiation in vitro, as \nwell as providing the first in vivo evidence on circulating \nmiRNAs from radiation-treated mice. Regardless, there has \nbeen limited exploration in the PDAC space to date.\nIn PDAC, ionizing radiation has been shown to be associ-\nated with upregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin \n(mTOR) activity via downregulating the mTOR-regulator \nmiR-99, leading to increased pancreatic cancer cell survival \nand resistance to radiation [122]. More recently, radiation \nwas found to upregulate miR-193-5p levels in PDAC cells \nin vitro which subsequently inhibited zinc finger protein 57 \n(ZFP57) and thus activated the WNT pathway, promoting \nresistance to radiation-induced cell death [123]. Radiation \nhas also been demonstrated to promote EV secretion in can-\ncer cells and a recent study found that radiation-exposed \npancreatic cancer cells increased production of miR-194-5p \ncontaining EVs, which led to increased tumour repopulation \nfor radiation [124]. However, the limitation of in vitro stud-\nies should be taken into consideration while reviewing the \nrole of miRNAs in radiation resistance, since irradiating cell \nlines in culture does not fully recapitulate human patients in \nterms of radiation dosage, 3D tumour organisation and het-\nerogeneity. The current dogma on the association between \nmiRNA and radiotherapy resistance can only be verified by \nfurther research particularly in measuring patient samples. \nIn addition, previous studies have shown that serum miRNA \nexpression levels are modified post-radiotherapy in human \npatients of breast and prostate cancer [125, 126]. Similar \ncharacterisation of serum miRNA changes in PDAC patients \nbefore and after radiation exposure as well as correlating \nthose to prognosis will further reveal the potential of utilis-\ning miRNA as an indication of radiotherapy efficacy.\nmiRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic \nbiomarkers for pancreatic cancer\nDiagnostic value\nThe 5-year overall survival rate for localised stage I PDAC is \naround 80%, but as soon as the tumour has spread to lymph \nnodes or to distant sites the survival rate significantly drops \nto 3.2% and 2.8% respectively [127]. Considering the gener-\nally poor prognosis of PDAC, the key to improving outcome \nis to diagnose patients at earlier stage while surgical resec-\ntion is still feasible. Unlike some other cancers such as breast \nand colorectal cancer, where non-invasive routine checks for \nthe general population have been implemented, examining \na biopsy tissue remains the gold standard for diagnosing \nand staging PDAC. However, biopsy is mostly only obtained \nwhen patients become symptomatic and as a result, over \n80% of these patients are diagnosed with metastatic PDAC \nat this point. Currently, the only routinely used blood bio-\nmarker is elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9, which \nis not specific to PDAC and is sometimes an indication of \nnon-malignant conditions, such as chronic pancreatitis (CP) \nand diabetes mellitus. In PDAC, CA19-9 typically has low \nsensitivity and specificity of 80% and 75% respectively \n[128]. In addition, CA19-9 has little value in diagnosing \nTable 3   Recent evidence of miRNAs that can be used to sensitise \nPDAC patients against chemotherapy\nKLF6 Krüppel-like factor 6, CLIC5 chloride intracellular channel 5, \nFOXD1 forkhead box D1, SNA1 Snail Family Transcriptional Repres-\nsor 1, HIF-1α hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha\nmiRNA\nIntervention\nTarget mRNA Chemo-\ntherapy\nReferences\n-342-3p\nInhibition\nKLF6\nGemcitabine\n[117]\n-1307\nInhibition\nCLIC5\nFOL-\nFIRINOX\n[116]\n-30a-5p\nOverexpres-\nsion\nFOXD1\nGemcitabine\n[52]\n-30a\nOverexpres-\nsion\nSNA1\nGemcitabine\n[115]\n-3662\nOverexpres-\nsion\nHIF-1α\nGemcitabine\n[68]\n-125a-3p\nOverexpres-\nsion\nFyn\nGemcitabine\n[118]"}, {"page_number": 13, "text": "175\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\t\nasymptomatic PDAC patients as 15–25% patients with pan-\ncreatic cancer also have low CA19-9 level [129].\nTherefore, one major focus on PDAC research is discov-\nering new biomarkers that are present in easily accessible \nsamples, such as blood and other bodily fluids which are \neasier to obtain, and have the potential as diagnostic, prog-\nnostic and even surveillance biomarkers to screen for early-\nstage pancreatic malignancy. In recent years, the discovery \nof tumour produced miRNA-containing EVs into the circu-\nlation has generated much excitement [93]. The lipid bilayer \nof exosomes protects miRNAs against enzymatic degrada-\ntion and exosomes have been shown to be extremely stable at \n4˚C, -20˚C and -80˚C, making them an excellent biomarker \ncandidate [130]. Furthermore, miRNAs in EVs are also \nknown to be stable at 37˚C [131]. A protocol optimised by \nDittmar et al. only required 20 µL plasma to collect around \n68 different miRNAs, suggesting that miRNA detection as \na biomarker in human plasma could be performed on small \nquantities and more importantly, in high throughput [96]. \nWe have summarised some of the recent work on miRNA \nas PDAC biomarkers in a range of human bodily fluids \n(Table 4). To improve the overall diagnostic accuracy, sev-\neral studies also investigated the sensitivity and specificity \nof miRNA biomarkers in combination with CA19-9.\nWhile CA19-9 and clinical symptoms cannot reliably \ndifferentiate between different pancreatic disorders, studies \nrevealed that there are tumour/serum miRNAs specific to \nPDAC which can aid accurate and non-invasive diagnosis \n[26, 132]. A study by Makler elucidated the tumour miR-\nNAs (miR-31, -210, -339, -429, -1208) that are differentially \nexpressed between chronic pancreatitis (CP) and PDAC, \nwhich is clinically valuable to ensuring a correct diagno-\nsis [133]. They also discovered 18 altered miRNAs that are \nexpressed in different stages of PDAC, which would also \nprovide important information with regard to PDAC pro-\ngression [133]. On the other hand, by analysing a total of \n125 serum samples from healthy control or patients with \neither PDAC or CP, the authors found that 5 miRNAs (miR-\n215-5p, -122-5p, -192-5p, -30b-5p, -320b) were able to dis-\ntinguish PDAC patients from non-PDAC individuals with \nCP and otherwise healthy, which is clinically valuable to \nensuring a correct diagnosis particularly in CP patients who \noften have similar symptoms [25]. Besides CP and PDAC, \nanother study has identified the differentially expressed \nserum miRNA profiles from other pancreatic lesions or neo-\nplasms, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, intra-\nductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and ampulla of Vater \ncarcinoma, which could also be used in the clinic to assist \ndiagnosis with further validation [134]. Six other serum \nmiRNAs (miR-574-3p, -1202, -4466, -6831-5p and -6089) \nwere found to independently differentiate early PDAC \npatients from healthy volunteers with a better area under \nthe ROC curve (AUC) than that of serum CA19-9, indicating \nmiRNAs are highly valuable in diagnosing patients in early \nstage PDAC, which coupled with intervention would lead \nto a higher chance of survival [135]. Finally, a recent study \nfrom Nakamura et al. optimised the use of 13 serum miR-\nNAs, which could differentiate all stages PDAC from healthy \ncontrols, and more remarkably achieved excellent ability in \ndiagnosing early stage PDAC (AUC: 0.93; sensitivity: 80%; \nspecificity: 91%) [129]. The combination of this panel of \nmiRNAs and serum CA19-9 level, was a superior diagnostic \ntool for early PDAC (AUC: 0.99; sensitivity: 93%; specific-\nity: 93%), and presents a promising diagnostic approach for \nearly detection of PDAC.\nIn addition to examining biomarkers in blood through \nliquid biopsy, research has also focussed on other bodily flu-\nids that may contain tumour-specific miRNAs. For example, \npancreatic juice collected from the duodenum during endo-\nscope ultrasound (EUS) is thought to contain more miR-\nNAs derived from the pancreas/tumour since it is produced \nby ductular cells in the pancreas, whereas plasma/serum \nmiRNAs may be derived from other organs. The first study \nthat investigated exosomal miRNAs in pancreatic juice was \nfrom Nakamura and colleagues in 2019. Although it only \nincluded 35 samples, they found that miR-21 and miR-155 \ncan be used to identify PDAC patients from CP patients. \nThe accuracy of diagnosis was further increased when pan-\ncreatic juice cytology was assessed in combination with the \nprofiling of miRNA biomarkers [131]. In addition, a second \nstudy on pancreatic juice has recently shown that a panel \nof miRNAs (miR-21, -25, -16) in combination with serum \nCA19-9 level can improve the sensitivity and specificity in \ndifferentiating between PDAC patients and healthy control \n(75.5% and 86.7 respectively), when compared to serum \nmiRNAs plus CA19-9 [27].\nOther miRNAs have also been discovered as biomark-\ners to predict elevated risk for metastasis. The expression \nof 6 miRNAs (miR-155–5p, -196b-5p, -365a-5p, -629–5p, \n-675–3p and -92b-3p) in tumour biopsies from human PDAC \npatients were found to be significantly correlated to higher \nrisk of lymph node metastasis, and improved the accuracy \nin diagnosing lymph node metastasis in combination with \nserum CA19-9 levels [136]. Another study indicated that \nserum miR-4669 can differentiate the presence of lymph \nnode metastasis from healthy control and PDAC patients that \nhave absence of lymph node metastasis, something which \ncannot be determined with CA19-9 [99]. As such, utilising \nmiRNA biomarkers present in patient samples may be able \nto accurately provide more information about disease pro-\ngression without the need for invasive procedures.\nPrognostic value\nThe initial evidence supporting the potential of miR-\nNA’s prognostic value was Takamizawa et al. who found"}, {"page_number": 14, "text": "176\n\t\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\nconsistently reduced let-7 expression levels in lung cancer \npatients significantly associated with worse survival out-\ncomes post-tumour resection [147, 148]. Following this, a \nlarge clinical study involving a total of 686 patients, showed \nthat high miR-21 expression in PDAC tumours was signifi-\ncantly correlated with shorter overall survival, along with \nother clinical features of advanced development, such as \nhigh tumour grade and presence of lymph node metastasis \n[149]. However, those patients with high miR-21 expres-\nsion are also predicted to have an increased survival benefit \nafter receiving gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy as \ncompared to low miR-21 patients.

The currently published data on miRNA expres-\nsion, both in pre-clinical models and patient specimens, \nare often inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. For \ninstance, miR-10b is found to be downregulated in PDAC \ncell lines and tumours [43] but the opposite was found in \nother studies utilising human PDAC tumour and pancreatic \nlesion samples [155, 156]. Different miRNA expression pro-\nfiles can be found even in the same patient cohort, possibly \ndue to the heterogeneity of the disease in question. This cre-\nates an obstacle in using miRNA as a reliable diagnostic \ntool, which has resulted in more recent studies developing \npanels of miRNA signatures that are used in combination \nwith serum CA19-9, hoping to increase the sensitivity and \nspecificity in PDAC detection. Some of these discrepancies \ncould be due to using different miRNA extraction protocols. \nEmerging studies have re-emphasised the need to standard-\nise protocols to achieve consistent and comparable results, \nand novel protocols are being developed to achieve better \nEV isolation [157, 158]. Considering the limited availability \nof patient specimens, efforts have been made to increase \nmiRNA detection and characterisation from low volumes, \nwith some approaches now requiring as little as 20 µL of \nplasma/sera. While there is currently an increased inter-\nest into miRNAs in a broader range of bodily fluids, it is \nimportant to note that miRNA expression typically varies \nbetween sample type. For example, there are large differ-\nences between tissues and plasma [81], therefore we should \nbe cautious on referencing previous sequencing results from \ndifferent samples of origin. Another major controversy on \nthe use of miRNA as diagnostic marker is that miRNA in the \ncirculation may not tumour specific and could be altered due \nto malignancies originating in other organs. A good example \nis oncogenic miR-21 which is found to be overexpressed in \nmany other cancers other than PDAC, such as lung and colo-\nrectal cancer [159]. Future studies in developing miRNA \ndiagnostic biomarkers will need to focus on improving the \nspecificity of its detection in PDAC before miRNA can be \nroutinely used in the clinic.\nmiRNAs as therapeutic targets in pancreatic \ncancer\nIn recent years, an increasing number of dysregulated miR-\nNAs have been discovered in cancer and extensive evidence \nsuggested that they directly regulate cancer-associated \nmRNAs and downstream signalling pathways. Targeting \ncancer through manipulating miRNAs is appealing since \nit might allow personalised treatment based on individu-\nal’s specific gene or miRNA expression profile and could \npotentially overcome chemotherapy resistance especially \nin PDAC. There are generally two ways in targeting miR-\nNAs: miRNA inhibition and miRNA replacement/mimick-\ning [160]. Inhibiting miRNA can be achieved using small \nmolecules such as anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), \nantisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and miRNA sponges that \nbind to target miRNA via a complementary base sequence \nand prevent them from binding to target mRNA. On the \nother hand, miRNA replacement therapy involves the use \nof synthetic miRNA or miRNA mimics to inhibit tumour-\npromoting mRNA activities by post-translational suppres-\nsion. For example, miR-506 has previously been established \nas a tumour suppressing miRNA in PDAC, and research-\ners have shown that by transfecting a tumour-suppressing \nmiR-506 mimic into cancer cells in vitro or by delivering \nnanoparticle packaged miR-506 mimic into a mouse xeno-\ngraft model, that it led to an anti-proliferative and apoptotic \neffect in cancer cells, thereby suppressing tumour growth \nin vivo [161]. More excitingly, multiple tumour suppress-\ning effects of miR-506 have been uncovered ranging from \naltered cell cycle progression, promotion of senescence, \nincreased autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS) gen-\neration, due to miR-506’s ability to bind and regulate several \noncogenic mRNAs, including STAT3 [162], EZH2 [163], \nCDK4/6 [164] that are all part of important downstream \npathways mediating cell cycle, survival, and apoptosis. This \nwork illustrates how powerful miRNA can be as a thera-\npeutic strategy to target multiple cellular processes at once.\nMicroRNAs can also be modified to improve the efficacy \nof current standard-of-care chemotherapy. When miR-15a \nwas integrated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU-miR-15a) and used \nto treat pancreatic cancer cells, not only did it significantly \ninhibit cancer cell proliferation, but it also sensitised the \ncancer cells to gemcitabine [44]. More importantly, treat-\ning PDAC metastatic mice with 5-FU-miR-15a alone sig-\nnificantly reduced metastatic growth in vivo compared to \ngemcitabine monotherapy, and an even stronger response \nwas observed in the 5-FU-miR-15a plus gemcitabine com-\nbination treatment group. In a separate study, a combina-\ntion therapy of nanoparticle CXCR4, ­siKRASG12D and anti-\nmiR-210 inhibited cancer cell interactions with pancreatic \nstellate cells to slow tumour progression and reduce stromal \ndesmoplasia to  increase drug delivery in pre-clinical mouse \nmodels of PDAC [109].\nDespite promising results in pre-clinical models, effec-\ntive delivery of miRNA-based therapies to the tumour \nsite without systemic toxicity remains a major concern in \nbringing miRNA therapeutics to the clinic. Free miRNAs \nrapidly degrade and cannot be taken up by cells, so miR-\nNAs must be packaged into and transported in vehicles"}, {"page_number": 17, "text": "179\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\t\nsuch as non-viral carriers (liposome, nanoparticle, EV, \nminicell), viral vectors (retroviral, lentiviral) or chemi-\ncally modified to be conjugated with other molecules. \nTo date, only two miRNA-based therapeutics for cancers \nhave been tested in clinical trials and both have utilised \ndifferent vehicles for delivery. In 2017, the first clinical \ntrial (NCT02369198) testing a novel technology named \nTargomiRs commenced. TargomiRs are bacterial-derived \nminicells that contain miRNA mimics and are designed \nto recognise a specific target. In this study, the TargomiR \nMesomiR-1 contains tumour suppressive miR-16 and anti-\nbodies that recognise epidermal growth factor receptor \n(EGFR), which is often found overexpressed and associ-\nated with worse prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer \n(NSCLC). Restoring levels of miR-16 was previously \nfound to ameliorate tumour progression in vivo. Early \nresults showed that intravenously injected MesomiR-1 \nwas safe in patients with no adverse effects, and this study \nis now moving forward to a phase II trial [165]. Unfor-\ntunately, the second miRNA therapy that was tested for \nsafety, the liposomal miR-34a mimic (MRX34) caused \nsevere immune-related reactions and the study was sus-\npended prematurely [166]. This was thought to be as a \nresult of the miRNA activating the innate immune system \nthrough stimulating inflammatory cytokine production and \nthe immune system against the liposomal vehicle [167, \n168].\nGiven that the survival rate of PDAC has not signifi-\ncantly improved over the past decades, the potential for \ntherapeutic miRNA-based approaches targeting multiple \ncancer-associated mRNAs is particularly appealing to treat \nthis multifaceted disease. However, this may also represent \na double-end sword as miRNA-based therapies could illicit \nbroad off-target effects leading to adverse life-threatening \noutcomes. Future studies will be required to focus on the \nmode of delivery that ensures target specificity and low \ntoxicity before miRNA therapy can be routinely used in \nthe clinic.\nFuture directions and challenges in miRNA \nresearch in pancreatic cancer\nAs the field of miRNA research expands, there have been \nmany exciting findings regarding miRNAs playing impor-\ntant roles in cancer. Advancements in technologies have also \naccelerated our current understanding of this class of small \nRNAs. As mRNAs are the direct target of miRNAs, it is \nideal to co-profile both miRNAs and mRNAs in the same \nsample to begin correlating change in expressions of both \nand the inter-dependency of the two. While traditional bulk \nRNA sequencing is limited and ignores crucial elements \nsuch as tumour heterogeneity, the advent and increased \navailability of single cell sequencing is likely to become \nmore widely incorporated into the study of both miRNA \nand mRNA transcriptomes specific to individual cell types \n[169]. This will likely be further improved by platforms \nsuch as CSmiR which helps to identify target mRNAs of \ncell-specific miRNAs, and incorporates cell-to-cell com-\nmunication based on the miRNA-mRNA interactions [170]. \nSome sequencing data from patient samples, such as TCGA \nwhich have been made publicly available online accessible \nvia the Xenabrowser [171], present a rich source of miRNA \ndata and have been utilised by many to study differentially \nexpressed miRNAs in cancer. Since miRNAs often have \nmore than one target, and multiple miRNAs are able to tar-\nget the same mRNA, other online resources continue to be \ndeveloped to assist in predicting potential mRNA targets for \nfurther investigation (Table 6).\nWhile sequencing data are able to reveal a broad over-\nview of miRNA and RNA changes in samples, it requires \nfunctional validation to confirm biological effects. There-\nfore, miRTarBase is particularly valuable since it records \nall miRNAs and targets validated in functional assays such \nas luciferase reporter assays, western blot and quantita-\ntive polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) [174]. Due to the \nintrinsic cellular heterogeneity of many solid tumours and \nto overcome the limitation of bulk tissue sequencing, spatial \nTable 6   Online resources available for miRNA research\nDatabases\nFunctions\nReferences\nmiRBase\nSummarises all the published miRNA sequences and annotations\n[3]\nTargetScan\nPredicts miRNA targets\n[31]\nmiRWalk\nPredicts miRNA targets based on a machine-learning algorithm, TarPmiR\nAllows searches on the interactions between genes in signalling pathways or biological processes in diseases\n[172]\nmiRDB\nPredicts miRNA targets by a bioinformatic tool, MirTarget\n[173]\nmiRTarBase\nStores published studies that functionally validated miRNA targets\n[174]\nmiRCancerdb\nStores information on miRNA to gene/protein expression association in cancer, based on TCGA and TargetScan \ndata\n[175]\nMiREDiBASE Provides information on miRNA editing and modification that may affect miRNA biogenesis\n[176]"}, {"page_number": 18, "text": "180\n\t\nClinical & Experimental Metastasis (2024) 41:163–186\ndetection of miRNA expressions has recently received a lot \nof attention to being to investigate and map where a miRNA \nof interest is localised within a specific tissue. Traditionally \nthis has be achieved via fluorescent in situ hybridisation on \nformalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples [177]. \nHowever recent advancements in miRNAscope technology \nnow allows co-visualisation of miRNA, RNA and proteins \nsimultaneously [178]. In fact, integrating miRNA analysis \nwith other -omics data is becoming more widespread and is \nallowing researches to gain a more holistic all-round under-\nstanding of diseases [179–183].\nConclusion\nDespite remarkable progress in research which has allowed \nbetter understanding of PDAC, the survival rate has shown \nlittle improvement in the last three decades. This is mainly \ndue to late diagnosis and resistance to therapy. Increasing \nevidence has shown that deregulated miRNAs directly regu-\nlate cancer-associated mRNAs, and significantly contribute \nto PDAC initiation, progression, and treatment resistance. \nOngoing research has been focused on utilising miRNA as \na diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, as well as manipu-\nlating miRNA expression as novel therapy. While encour-\naging results have kickstarted several clinical trials started \nworldwide on using miRNA as a diagnostic marker, systemic \ntoxicity remains the major hindrance for the translation of \nmiRNA-based therapies into the clinic. Future research \nshould continue to uncover and map the biological signifi-\ncance of deregulated miRNAs in solid tumours, and explore \ntheir potential in early diagnosis, and prognosis as well as \ndeveloping novel approaches by which they can be targeted a \ntreatment modality to improve patient outcome and survival.\nAcknowledgements  TRC is supported by the National Health and \nMedical Research Council (NHMRC) ideas (2000937), project \n(1140125), and fellowship (1158590) funding, a Cancer Institute \nNSW Career Development Fellowship (CDF171105), a Cancer Coun-\ncil NSW project grant (RG19-09) and Susan G Komen for the Cure \n(CCR17483294).

Cancer-derived exosomes, benefiting from \nthe protective role of the lipid membrane, exhibit remarkable stability in the circulatory system. These exosomes, \nreleased by tumor microenvironment, contain various biomolecules such as proteins, RNAs, and lipids that \nplays a pivotal role in mediating distant communication between the local pancreatic tumor and other organs \nor tissues. They facilitate the transfer of oncogenic factors to distant sites, contributing to the compromised \nbody immune system, distant metastasis, diabetes, cachexia, and promoting a microenvironment conducive to \ntumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic cancer patients. Beyond their intrinsic roles, circulating exosomes in \nperipheral blood can be detected to facilitate accurate liquid biopsy. This approach offers a novel and promising \nmethod for the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. Consequently, circulating exosomes are not only \ncrucial mediators of systemic cell-cell communication during pancreatic cancer progression but also hold great \npotential as precise tools for pancreatic cancer management and treatment. Exosome-based liquid biopsy and \ntherapy represent promising advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Exosomes can \nserve as drug delivery vehicles, enhancing the targeting and efficacy of anticancer treatments, modulating the \nimmune system, and facilitating gene editing to suppress tumor growth. Ongoing research focuses on biomarker \nidentification, drug delivery systems, and clinical trials to validate the safety and efficacy of exosome-based \ntherapies, offering new possibilities for early diagnosis and precision treatment in pancreatic cancer. Leveraging \nthe therapeutic potential of exosomes, including their ability to deliver targeted drugs and modulate immune \nresponses, opens new avenues for innovative treatment strategies.\nKeywords  Pancreatic cancer, Extracellular vesicles, Exosomes, Tumor microenvironment, Liquid biopsy\nThe systematic role of pancreatic cancer \nexosomes: distant communication, liquid \nbiopsy and future therapy\nCheng Qin1†, Tianyu Li1†, Chen Lin1†, Bangbo Zhao1, Zeru Li1, Yutong Zhao1 and Weibin Wang1*"}, {"page_number": 2, "text": "Page 2 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nBackground\nDespite amounts of effort thrown into medical research, \npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, generally named \npancreatic cancer, is still one of the most severe malig­\nnant diseases. According to the latest GLOBOCAN \nreport, pancreatic cancer has one of the poorest progno­\nses among cancers, ranking as the sixth leading cause of \ncancer mortality. There were an estimated 510,566 new \ncases and 467,005 deaths attributed to pancreatic cancer \nworldwide [1].\nCompared with the magnificent progress in the treat­\nments against other cancer types, the 5-year survival rate \nof pancreatic cancer remains about 10% [2]. Until today, \nradical operation provided the only way to cure pancre­\natic cancer. However, due to the hidden symptom in the \nearly stage, over 80% of patients lose the opportunity \nto receive an operation because of distant metastasis \nor obvious vessel invasion [3, 4]. Therefore, systematic \ntherapy combining surgery and chemotherapy is still the \nmain manner to manage pancreatic cancer.\nThe first-line chemotherapy regimens for pancreatic \ncancer vary based on the treatment stage and patient con­\ndition. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced \npancreatic cancer typically includes FOLFIRINOX or \ngemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, aiming to shrink tumors \nand facilitate surgical resection [5–7]. Adjuvant chemo­\ntherapy post-surgery often involves gemcitabine alone \nor combined with capecitabine, or mFOLFIRINOX for \nphysically fit patients, to reduce recurrence risk [8]. For \nmetastatic pancreatic cancer, palliative chemotherapy \noptions include FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus nab-\npaclitaxel for those in good health, and gemcitabine \nmonotherapy for frail patients, aiming to alleviate symp­\ntoms, extend survival, and improve quality of life [9, 10]. \nHowever, they still failed to dramatically improve the \nprognosis of pancreatic cancer patients due to chemo­\nresistance [11]. In addition to chemotherapy, radiother­\napy, another approved method to treat a variety of solid \ntumors, currently serves as a palliative manner to relieve \ncancerous pain, but with undesirable side effects [12].\nIn addition to conventional chemotherapy, several \nnovel treatment modalities are being explored for pan­\ncreatic cancer, including immunotherapy, targeted ther­\napy, and other systemic treatments [13]. Immunotherapy \nhas emerged as a promising approach in oncology, but its \nsuccess in pancreatic cancer has been limited. Targeting \nfocal adhesion kinase (FAK) with defactinib, combined \nwith pembrolizumab and gemcitabine, was investigated \nin a phase I study for PDAC [14]. They reported an 80% \ndisease control rate in refractory PDAC patients, yielding \na median PFS of 3.6 months and OS of 7.8 months. In the \nmaintenance cohort, the disease control rate was 70%, \nwith a median PFS of 5.0 months and OS of 8.3 months. \nAnother phase 1b/2 study tested the safety and antitumor \nactivity of niraparib combined with either nivolumab or \nipilimumab in advanced pancreatic cancer. The niraparib \nplus ipilimumab group achieved a 6-month progression-\nfree survival (PFS) of 59.6%, while the niraparib plus \nnivolumab group showed a PFS of 20.6% [15]. Targeted \ntherapies aim to exploit specific genetic mutations or \npathways involved in cancer growth. The PARP inhibi­\ntor olaparib has shown promise in patients with BRCA-\nmutated pancreatic cancer. In the POLO trial, olaparib as \nmaintenance therapy for germline BRCA-mutated meta­\nstatic pancreatic cancer led to a significant improvement \nin PFS (7.4 months with olaparib vs. 3.8 months with pla­\ncebo), though the OS benefit was not statistically signifi­\ncant [16]. Other systemic treatments include approaches \nsuch as oncolytic virus therapy and cancer vaccines. \nOncolytic viruses are designed to selectively infect and \nkill cancer cells, and preliminary trials have shown some \npromise in pancreatic cancer [17, 18]. In the phase 1 \nAMPLIFY-201 study, cancer vaccine ELI-002 2P showed \nno dose-limiting toxicities and induced mKRAS-spe­\ncific T cell responses in 84% of patients, with a median \nrelapse-free survival (RFS) of 16.33 months. The study \nfound a significant correlation between T cell responses \nand tumor biomarker reduction, indicating that ELI-002 \n2P is safe and effective in inducing T cell responses in \nKRAS-mutated tumors [19].\nDespite the array of novel therapeutic approaches \nbeing investigated, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer \npatients remains poor, with worsening social and physi­\ncal quality of life [13, 20]. Therefore, effective therapy \nagainst pancreatic cancer is urgently needed to solve the \ncurrent dilemma.\nAs the prerequisite, understanding pancreatic cancer \nclearly and thoroughly is the basis for developing novel \ntherapy. Compared to massive previous studies on malig­\nnant cells and tumor microenvironment [21], local pan­\ncreatic tumor also distantly communicates with other \ntissue and organs, affecting the tumor-host macroen­\nvironment [22]. Therefore, the communication among \nthem is vital for pancreatic cancer progression [23].\nExtracellular vesicles, including exosomes, microves­\nicles, and apoptotic bodies, differ significantly in their \nphysical characteristics, biological functions, and origins \n[24–26] and are extensively studied for their potential \ndiagnostic applications in pancreatic cancer [27]. Exo­\nsomes (30–150 nm) are small, spherical vesicles formed \nvia the endosomal pathway, playing roles in intercel­\nlular communication and genetic information trans­\nfer. Microvesicles (100-1,000 nm) bud directly from the \nplasma membrane and are involved in cell signaling and \ninflammation. Apoptotic bodies (50 − 5,000  nm) arise \nfrom cells undergoing programmed cell death and con­\ntain cellular debris, aiding in the clearance of apoptotic \ncells. Compared to other extracellular vesicles, exosomes"}, {"page_number": 3, "text": "Page 3 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nare the most extensively studied. They can be released by \nall cell types and are found in various body fluids, includ­\ning serum, blood plasma, and urine. Exosomes contain \nproteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids, making them a \nvital mediator in regulating distant cell-cell communica­\ntion [28] (Fig. 1).\nBenefiting from the Protective lipid bilayer membrane \nwith identifiable proteins (such as CD9, CD63, CD81), \nexosomes could mediate adjacent and long-distance \ncell-cell communication in both health and disease com­\npared to other secretory molecules [29]. Originally, exo­\nsomes are derived from endosomes. After encapsulating \nbiomolecules from cytosol through inward budding, \nlate endosome turns to be multivesicular body (MVB) \ncontaining massive intraluminal vesicles. Then, some \nintracellular MVB degrade to lysosomes, while others \nfuse with the cell membrane and release contained exo­\nsomes to extracellular space [30]. Such biosynthesis of \nexosomes in cancer cells is finely regulated by many mol­\necules under different conditions [31]. Although the pre­\ncise physiology of exosomes biogenesis remains not very \nclear, their role in facilitating tumorigenesis is relatively \nwidely researched.\nCirculating exosomes have significant utility in can­\ncer diagnostics [32]. They carry tumor-specific proteins, \nRNA, and DNA, enabling early detection and non-inva­\nsive diagnosis. As a noninvasive detection method, liquid \nbiopsy offers notable benefits over traditional diagnostic \nprocedures such as tissue biopsy, including enhanced \ncost-efficiency and convenience [33]. Exosomes can be \nstably present in bodily fluids, including blood, urine, and \nsaliva, making them highly promising for liquid biopsy \n[34]. Exosomes can also deliver therapeutic molecules \ndirectly to cancer cells, enhancing treatment efficacy and \nreducing side effects. Additionally, analyzing exosomal \ncontent provides insights into tumor biology and drug \nFig. 1  The communication between pancreatic tumor and other organs or tissues via exosomes.

Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nresistance mechanisms, aiding in the development of \npersonalized treatment strategies and real-time monitor­\ning of therapeutic responses [35]. Moreover, artificially \nmodified exosomes could also be employed as nanocarri­\ners in anticancer therapy [36]. Given the complex tumor \nmicroenvironment and poor prognosis of pancreatic can­\ncer, research on exosome-based liquid biopsies may offer \nmore effective diagnostic and prognostic methods for \nthis disease [37]. Exploring the application of exosomes \nin pancreatic cancer not only helps improve early detec­\ntion rates but also provides new approaches for personal­\nized treatment and improving survival rates.\nIn this review, we summarized current knowledge \nabout exosomes in mediating distant cell-cell commu­\nnication in pancreatic cancer. In addition, the potential \nclinical application and future research directions of exo­\nsomes in pancreatic cancer was also introduced.\nExosomes connecting local tumor \nmicroenvironment with other organs/tissues\nBody immune system\nImmune cells engage in comprehensive and dynamic \ncrosstalk with tumor cells in the pancreatic TME via \nexosomes [38, 39]. For instance, LncRNA SBF2-AS1 in \nM2 macrophages-derived exosomes endogenously com­\npete and suppress miR-122-5p expression in PCCs upon \nuptake, thus promoting XIAP protein level and acceler­\nating PC development [40]. Similarly, M2 macrophages \nrelease miR-193b-3p [41], miR-202-5p and miR-142-5p \n[42] to promote the proliferation, invasion, and migration \nof PC. Meanwhile, PC cell-derived exosome miR-210 \ncan promote macrophage M2 polarization via targeting \nand inhibiting FGFRL1, thereby activating the p-PI3K/p-\nAKT/p-mTOR pathway and promoting chemoresistance \n[43]. PC cells also generate Exosome lncRNA, such as \nFGD5-AS1, which induces M2 macrophage polarization \nand promote PC cells’ malignant behaviors [44]. Thanks \nto the protective effect of the lipid bilayer, exosomes \nsecreted by PC can also act on immune cells in the cir­\nculatory system as well as in other organs/tissues (Fig. 2).\nA previous study on rats showed that murine PCCs-\nderived exosomes could be internalized of a variety of \nleukocytes located in peritoneal exudate, spleen, periph­\neral blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Upon uptake, \nexosomes can hinder leukocytes activation and prolif­\neration via down-regulating of CD44v6 and inhibiting \nphosphorylation of LCK, ZAP70 and ERK1/2 [45]. Also, \nthey can occupy migration-associated ligands, such a as \nCD44, CD49d, CD54, and CD62L [46, 47], and signifi­\ncantly impair lymphocyte migration. Besides, the func­\ntions of CTLs, NKs, and tumor-lysate-loaded DCs were \nactivated, supporting immune response induction of \npancreatic cancer [45]. However, in circulating system, \nexosomes secreted by PCCs, especially those without \nSMAD4 expression, create an immunosuppressive \nmicroenvironment characterized by unbalanced imma­\nture myeloid cells by upregulating calcium fluxes and \nglycolysis, which potentially mediated by exo-miRNAs \nmiR-1260a and miR-494-3p [48].\nAdditionally, PCCs-derived exosomes were taken up by \ncirculating T lymphocytes, activating p38 mitogen-acti­\nvated protein kinase and inducing endoplasmic reticulum \nstress-mediated apoptosis of recipient cells, which finally \ncaused immunosuppression [49]. For instance, exosomal \nPD-L1 could inhibit circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes \nand promote PC invasion [50, 51]. In addition to the cyto­\ntoxic immune response, the humoral immune response \nhas a more large-scale battlefield involving immune tis­\nsue/organs, circulating system, and local tumor. PCCs-\nderived exosomes preferred to equip enriched tumor \nassociated antigens (TAAs) on their surface and induce B \ncells-mediated humoral immune response [52]. However, \nthose exosomes could absorb massive autoantibodies as \na decoy and facilitate PCCs to escape from complement-\nmediated cytotoxicity [53].\nFurthermore, PCCs-derived exosomes have been \ndemonstrated to inhibit the immune system by deregu­\nlating DCs in PBMC. After being taken up by DCs, miR-\n203-containing exosomes generated by PC cells can \nboost intracellular miR-203 levels and suppress the pro­\nduction of TLR4 and downstream cytokines (TNF-α and \nIL-12), finally causing their dysfunction [54]. Zech et al. \nrevealed that PCCs-derived exosomes acquired by DCs \ncan effectively suppress IL-2/PI3K/Akt signal pathway \nin the lymphocytes, which activated apoptosis [45]. Also, \nPCCs-derived exosomes suppress RFXAP expression via \nmiR-212-3p, resulting in decreased MHC II expression \nand immunological tolerance of DCs [55].\nThe resistance that pancreatic cancer develops to \nimmunotherapy is partly due to the accumulation of \nimmunosuppressive cells in the TME. Wong et al. \nrecently discovered that myeloid-derived suppres­\nsor cells (MDSC) formation in PC could be induced by \nmacrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) from the \ntumor-derived exosome. They also synthesized a MIF \ntautomerase inhibitor, which effectively inhibited exo­\nsome-induced MDSC differentiation and tumor growth \nin an orthotopic PC model by promoting CD8 + T cells \ninfiltration in the TME [56].\nDistant metastasis\nThe movement of tumor cells from vessel to tissue is \nimportant, thus the first step of distant metastasis. PCCs \ncould transmit tissue factors to endothelial cells through \ncirculating exosomes. With the help of factor VIIa and \nfactor Xa, those exosomes upregulated endothelial \nE-selectin and IL-8 synthesis, inducing pro-adhesive \nand pro-inflammatory phenotype of endothelial cells"}, {"page_number": 5, "text": "Page 5 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nand promoting metastasis [57]. Additionally, exosomes \ncircular RNA IARS (circ-IARS) from PCCs significantly \nenhanced endothelial monolayer permeability and pro­\nmoted blood-borne distant metastasis as well [58]. More­\nover, another recent study showed that hypoxic PCC \nsecreted exosomal miR-30b-5p targeted GJA1 in endo­\nthelial cells, promoting angiogenesis and distant metas­\ntasis [59]. However, PCC also could transmit exosomal \nmiR-29b to endothelial cells and repressed ROBO1 and \nSRGAP2, which inhibited angiogenesis and metastasis \n[60].\nLymphatic system is an important defense system of \nthe human body, consisting of lymphatic vessels, lym­\nphoid tissue, and lymphoid organs [61]. Current research \nis being devoted to understand how PC cells transfer to \nthe lymph nodes. A potential mediator that causes lym­\nphatic metastasis is exosomes [62–64]. Exosomal lnRNA \nLNMAT2 was proved to facilitate lymph-angiogenesis \nand lymphatic metastasis in bladder cancer via VEGF-\nC [65]. Also, cancer-secreted exosomal miRNAs could \npromote lymphatic metastasis in esophageal [66, 67], \ncervical [68], endometrial [69], gastric [70], and breast \ncancer [71]. In pancreatic cancer, Zhou et al. found that \nPCC-derived exosomes could promote lymph-angiogen­\nesis via downregulating ABHD11-AS1 expression and \nupregulating proliferation, migration, and tubes forma­\ntion in lymphatic endothelial cells [72].\nBesides the impact on vascular endothelial cells and \nlymphatic system (Fig. 3), the direct effects of exosomes \non target organs were also significant to construct pre­\nmetastatic niche. The disposition of PCC-derived exo­\nsomes in target organs, such as macrophages in lung and \nbone marrow, could be detected before any metastases \nare present [73]. The underlying molecular mechanism of \nexosomes in driving distant metastasis is being gradually \nrevealed. Liver, peritoneum, and lung are common meta­\nstatic sites in pancreatic cancer patients [74]. The pattern \nof PCC-derived exosomes involvement in liver metastasis \nis illustrated in Fig. 4. Primary tumor cells could secrete \nexosomes to modify the extracellular matrix of other \norgans, rendering them to be receptive to metastatic \nseeding. For example, specific integrins on PCC-derived \nFig. 2  Impact of Pancreatic Cancer Exosomes on the Immune System and Tumor Microenvironment. This illustration depicts the complex interplay \nbetween pancreatic cancer cells and the body’s immune system, highlighting how pancreatic cancer exosomes weaken immune responses. On the left, \nthe pancreatic tumor microenvironment restricts the activation and migration of lymphocytes, leading to impaired activation and proliferation of distant \nT and B lymphocytes (center). The diagram also shows circulating immature myeloid cells creating an immunosuppressive background, and pancreatic \ncancer cell (PCC) exosomes impairing humoral immunity through massive antibodies and tumor-associated antigens. On the right, circulating dendritic \ncells (DCs) exhibit dysfunction and humoral immune is impaired, contributing to a compromised immune system. Additionally, circulating T lymphocytes \nshow impaired activation, exemplified by PD-1 and PD-L1 interactions. The overall effect is a compromised body immune system that struggles to ef­\nfectively attack pancreatic cancer"}, {"page_number": 6, "text": "Page 6 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nexosomes could drive different metastasis. Exosomes \nwith integrin αvβ5 mediated liver tropism whereas α6β4 \nand α6β1 contributed lung tropism, which could induce \npro-inflammatory pathways in recipient cells and create \npre-metastatic niches in target organs [75]. Macrophage \nmigration inhibitory factor (MIF), enriched in pancre­\natic tumor exosomes, could impel hepatic Kupffer cells \nto secrete and release TGF-β. Then, the fibronectin pro­\nduction of hepatic stellate cells was upregulated, which \nincreased the recruitment of bone marrow-derived mac­\nrophages and promoted liver pre-metastatic niche forma­\ntion [76]. Besides the stimulation mediated by Kupffer \ncells, PCC-derived exosomes containing CD44v6 and \ncomplement C1q binding protein (C1QBP) complex con­\ntributed to the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT pathway \nand α-SMA expression in hepatic stellate cells directly, \nwhich enhanced liver fibrosis and liver metastasis of pan­\ncreatic cancer [77]. Additionally, another recent report \nsuggested that PCCs-derived exosomes could repro­\ngram the transcriptome of CD11b + cells in bone marrow, \nwhich might subsequently turn to be bone marrow-\nderived macrophages within tumor microenvironment \nand liver premetastatic niches [78]. Also, the PCCs-\nderived exosome tRF-GluCTC-0005 was able to recruit \nFig. 3  Mechanisms by which circulating PCC-derived exosomes act on vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells to promote metastasis"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "Page 7 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nMDSCs and activated hepatic stellate cells in the liver, \nwhich created an immunosuppressive microenviron­\nment and further promoted liver metastasis [79]. More­\nover, PCC also transferred exosomes with metabolites, \nparticularly palmitic acid, to Kupffer cells in liver, induc­\ning fatty liver and systemically dysregulated metabolism \nin pancreatic cancer patients. As a result, the systemic \nimmune functions were compromised, and the distant \nmetastasis was accelerated [80].\nExcept for promoting liver metastasis, PCCs with low \nprotein kinase D1 (PKD1) expression preferred to secret \nα6β4 positive exosomes, which promoted lung metas­\ntasis of pancreatic cancer [81]. Additionally, PCCs with \nmutant p53 released exosomes containing certain podo­\ncalyxin levels, which could influence the motility of \nfibroblasts and promote the formation of pro-invasive \nextracellular matrix in distant organs, such as lung [82]. \nAfter injection of PC ascites-derived exosomes from PC \npatients in mice, the vascular permeability in the lung \nwas promoted, leading to the extravasation and colo­\nnization of PCCs [83]. Compared with liver and lung \nmetastasis, the underlying mechanism of possible exo­\nsome-mediated peritoneal metastasis in pancreatic can­\ncer remains to be elucidated.\nDiabetes\nExtensive epidemiological evidence suggested that dia­\nbetes could serve as both a risk factor and clinical mani­\nfestation of pancreatic cancer [84, 85]. However, the \nunderlying molecular mechanism between pancreatic \ncancer and diabetes remains unclear [86]. PCC-derived \nexosomes may cause changes in the whole pancreatic \nislets including intra-tumoral islets, resulting in the \noccurrence of pancreatic cancer-related diabetes [87, \n88]. In addition, the development of diabetes is not only \nrelated to the pancreatic islets, but also to the sugar \nuptake and fat metabolism of peripheral tissues such \nas muscle tissue [89]. We have revealed the biological \nFig. 4  Mechanisms by which circulating PCC-derived exosomes act on a hepatic Kupffer cells and stellate cells to promote liver metastasis"}, {"page_number": 8, "text": "Page 8 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nmechanisms of exosomes in mediating this process \n(Fig. 5).\nTumor-derived EVs could transfer miR-122 to β-cells \nand target pyruvate kinase M (PKM), thus suppressing \nglycolysis and insulin secretion, promoting glucose toler­\nance, fasting hyperglycemia, eventually contributing to \nthe impairment of whole-body glucose homeostasis [90]. \nIn PC, adrenomedullin was up-regulated and responsible \nfor β-cells insulin resistance [91]. PCCs-derived exosomes \ntransmitted adrenomedullin to β-cells, which caused \nendoplasmic reticulum stress and β-cell dysfunction. \nTherefore, insulin secretion was indirectly suppressed \nby PCCs [92]. Also, adrenomedullin can be loaded into \nexosomes derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts, \nand then delivered to recipient adipocytes to enhance \nlipolysis in the adipose tissues [93], which was reck­\noned as a hallmark of diabetes [94]. MiR-19a contained \nin PCCs-derived exosomes was also reported to regu­\nlate insulin secretion. It was found that miR-19a induced \nβ-cell dysfunction via targeting ADCY1 and EPAC2 \n[95], as well as inhibited insulin production via targeting \nNeurod1 in pancreatic β cells [96]. Additionally, another \nrecent report showed that Vanin-1 in PCC-derived exo­\nsomes could impair adjacent islets by producing oxida­\ntive stress and β-cell dedifferentiation, leading to diabetes \n[97]. In addition, the secretion and function of insulin \nwere affected by many other regulators. Glucagon-like \npeptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic \npeptide (GIP) are two important hormones contributing \nto glucose homeostasis through enhancing insulin secre­\ntion and sensitivity. Exosomes miRNAs (miR-6796-3p, \nmiR-6763-5p, miR-4750-3p, and miR-197-3p) from PCCs \ncould suppress proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin \ntype 1/3 (PCSK1/3) in enteroendocrine cells, subse­\nquently inhibiting GLP1 and GIP secretion [98].\nDecreased peripheral glucose use also contributes to \nthe pathogenesis of diabetes. PCCs-derived exosomes \ncould inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in muscle \ncells, resulting in compromised expression of glucose \ntransporter 4 protein (GLUT4) and insulin resistance \n[99]. Besides, Wang et al. proved that PCCs-derived \nexosomal miR-let-7b-5p stimulated insulin resistance in \nskeletal muscle cells via targeting RNF20 and activating \nSTAT3/FOXO1 pathway [100].\nCachexia\nCachexia is a prominent and frequent clinical feature of \npancreatic cancer, which is mainly characterized by non-\nintentional weight loss, such as sarcopenia and adipope­\nnia [101]. Importantly, cachexia is associated with poor \nlife quality and even death in pancreatic cancer patients, \nattracting massive attention from clinicians and nutri­\ntionists [101]. As another systematic syndrome besides \nFig. 5  Mechanisms by which circulating PCC-derived exosomes act on pancreatic β-cells, muscle cells and enteroendocrine cells to promote the devel­\nopment of diabetes"}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "Page 9 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \ndiabetes, the cachexia process in pancreatic cancer could \nalso be partially attributed to exosomes.\nWeight loss and malnutrition due to cachexia are often \ncaused by muscle, fat, and even bone catabolism. Tumor-\nreleased extracellular surface heat shock protein 70 \n(HSP70) and Hsp90 were identified as key factors caus­\ning myotube atrophy and muscle wasting [102–104]. \nPCCs released markedly increased levels Hsp70/Hsp90-\ncontaining EVs, which targeted in myotubes and resulted \nin the loss of the myosin heavy chain and myotube diam­\neter via upregulating of p38 MAPK, C/EBPβ, and LC3-\nII [103]. Another study by Yang et al. reported that ZIP4 \ncould induce muscle loss and cachexia by activating \nCREB-regulated expression of RAB27B, a key regulator \nrequired for EVs releasing in PCCs. Those exosomes con­\ntaining high levels of HSP70 and HSP90 could stimulate \nToll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the recipient muscle cells, \nfinally promoting p38 MAPK-mediated muscle catabo­\nlism and cachexia [105].\nAdditionally, the abovementioned adrenomedullin in \nPCCs-derived exosomes could activate ERK1/2 and p38 \nMAPK pathways in adipocytes, contributing to lipolysis \nin adipose tissue and weight loss [106]. Another study \nby Shibata et al. reported that intravenous injection of \nPCCs-derived EVs could promote lipolysis and negatively \naffect body weight in mice model. They also revealed \nthat EVs in PC patients’ serum exhibit higher ITGA6 and \nITGB1 expression levels, which allowed them to be pref­\nerentially distributed to the adipose tissue [107].More­\nover, compared with the healthy control, the expression \nof genes for browning, lipolysis, fibrosis, and acute \ninflammation was upregulated in subcutaneous adipo­\ncytes exposed to plasma exosomes from pancreatic can­\ncer patients [108].\nA recent report also suggested that PCCs-derived \nexosomal miR-125a-5p could induce osteoclast differ­\nentiation and cancer-related bone loss [109], further indi­\ncating the role of exosomes in pancreatic cancer patients \naccompanied with cachexia.\nClinical values of exosomes in diagnosis, \nmonitoring, and therapy\nDiagnosis and monitoring\nDue to non-specific symptoms at early stage, about 80% \nof pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed to be the \nadvanced stage when initially evaluated. Therefore, early \ndetection is significant and promising for improving the \ndismal prognosis [110, 111]. Benefiting from the protec­\ntive role of lipid bilayer membrane and CD47 transmem­\nbrane protein, exosomes carrying specific information \nabout pancreatic cancer is relatively stable in the circulat­\ning system and less likely eliminated by monocytes [112], \nproviding the possibility of early diagnosis via liquid \nbiopsy (Table 1).\nStudies based on proteomics suggested that protein \nsignatures of exosomes derived from patients’ plasma \ncould reflect the pathophysiology of pancreatic cancer \n[113]. Also, the phenotype signatures of plasma-derived \nexosomes in pancreatic cancer patients were proved to \nhave high diagnostic accuracy and strongly correlated \nwith tumor stages [114]. Through analyzing the levels of \nglypican 1 (GPC1) exosomes in serum, a study involving \nGerman patients revealed that GPC1 exosomes could \nperfectly distinguish pancreatic cancer from healthy \ndonors and individuals with benign pancreatic diseases. \nThe AUC was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.988–1.0), with 100% sensi­\ntivity and 100% specificity [115]. By performing immune \nlipoplex nanoparticle biochip assay, Li et al. validated that \ncirculating exosomes GPC1 could serve as a viable bio­\nmarker for PC which was validated in clinical cohorts at \nmultiple hospitals [116]. While GPC1 alone showed high \naccuracy, combining Exosomes GPC1, CD82, and serum \nCA199 levels could also realize better diagnostic effi­\nciency, achieving an AUC of 0.942 (95% CI: 0.882–1.000) \n[117]. Similarly, the combination of exosomal markers \nEGFR, EpCAM, WNT2, and GPC1 demonstrated excel­\nlent diagnostic efficiency, achieving an AUC of 1.0, with a \nsensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 90% [118]. However, \nanother study suggested that circulating exosomes GPC1 \nwas not diagnostic for pancreatic cancer, but indicated \nhigh levels of miR-181a, miR-10b, miR-21, miR-30c, and \nlow levels of miR-let7a in plasma exosomes could effec­\ntively differentiate pancreatic cancer from healthy donors \nand chronic pancreatitis patients [119]. The variations \nbetween different groups’ findings can be attributed to \nseveral factors, including differences in blood preserva­\ntion conditions, exosome extraction methods, protein/\nRNA quantification techniques, and population demo­\ngraphics. These factors can significantly influence the \nresults and lead to discrepancies between studies. Cur­\nrently, the role of exosomes in liquid biopsy field is \ngaining momentum. Nakamura et al. [120]. adopted exo­\nsome-based liquid biopsy to establish a 13 miRNAs sig­\nnature which not only showed high diagnostic accuracy \n(AUC = 0.98 for training cohort; AUC = 0.93 for valida­\ntion cohort) for all stages of PDAC but also successfully \nidentified CA19-9 negative patients (AUC = 0.96, sen­\nsitivity = 91% and specificity = 90%), demonstrating the \npotential superiority than CA19-9. Besides, when com­\nbined with CA19-9 levels, the diagnostic accuracy signifi­\ncantly improved (AUC = 0.99 compared to AUC = 0.86 for \nCA19-9 alone).\nOther relevant studies also suggested that plasma \nexosomes microRNAs (miR-409, miR-191, miR-21, \nmiR-451a, miR-19b, miR-335-5p, miR-340-5p, miR-\n451,miR-720), mRNAs (CK18, CD63, FGA, KRT19, \nHIST1H2BK, ITIH2, MARCH2, CLDN1, MAL2, TIMP1, \nWASF2, and ARF6), small nucleolar RNAs (SNORA74A"}, {"page_number": 10, "text": "Page 10 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nand SNORA25), and proteins (ZIP4, EphA2, ALIX, \nADAM8) could assist to pancreatic cancer diagnosis \n[120–135]. Besides blood, exosomes in saliva provided \ninformation about pancreatic cancer as well. Exosomes \nfrom the saliva of mice models bearing orthotopically \nimplanted pancreatic cancer had higher mRNAs (Apb­\nblip, Aspn, Incenp, Daf2, and Foxp1) [136]. Furthermore, \nSaliva-derived exosomal miR-1246 and miR-4644 ful­\nfilled pancreatic cancer diagnosis with 83.3% sensitivity \nand 92.3% specificity [137], which revealed a more conve­\nnient and non-invasive method for potentially diagnosing \npancreatic cancer (Table 1).\nRecently, a novel method for mutational protein anal­\nysis of single extracellular vesicle has been developed, \nwhich can capture individual extracellular vesicles and \nanalyze multiple protein markers within them based \non antibody capture and fluorescence imaging [138]. \nResearchers found KRASmut and P53mut could serve as \nextracellular vesicle markers for detecting pancreatic \ncancer. By applying this method, PDAC with volume of \nmerely 0.1 cubic centimeters was successfully detected, \nfar superior to current clinical imaging detection capa­\nbilities [138].\nIn addition to diagnosis, accurately and dynamically \nmonitoring the status of patients during cancer course \nis vital for individualized therapy and long-term survival \n[139] (Table 1).

Besides predicting early recurrence, the panel con­\ntaining serum exosomal miR-1299, GAPDH (mRNA), \ncirculating mutant KRAS allele fraction, and CA199 lev­\nels could effectively predict occult distant metastasis of \npancreatic cancer, which was significantly better than \nimaging alone [121]. Decreased exosomal EphA2 levels \nin plasma could reflect good/partial response to neoadju­\nvant therapy in pancreatic cancer patients [125]. Besides \nthat, increased KRAS mutant allele fraction in exosomal \nDNA could predict disease progression during neoadju­\nvant treatment, which was superior to elevated CA19-9 \nlevels [142].\nHowever, there is no available assay approved by Food \nand Drug Administration for pancreatic cancer diagnosis \nand monitoring. Hence, the results of previous publica­\ntions remain further validation in high-quality clinical \ntrials. Additionally, the methods for isolating exosomes in \nclinical use should also be optimized and unified [143].\nTherapy\nCompared with free drug and synthetic nanoparticles \nsuch as liposomes, exosomes, which are naturally gener­\nated nanoscale EVs with innate properties well suited to \nlipids, shuttle proteins, and nucleic acids between cells \n[144], can be loaded with drugs while freely traversing \nacross dense tumor stroma, avoiding degeneration and \nimmune clearance [145, 146]. Additionally, PCCs-derived \nexosomes were preferentially taken up by tumor tissue \nin orthotopic mice models [147, 148]. Such enhanced \nuptake of exosomes might be mediated by oncogenic \nKRAS, which promoted macropinocytosis in pancreatic \ncancer [112, 149]. Therefore, exosomes provided promis­\ning novel opportunities for pancreatic cancer treatment. \nHowever, their therapeutic effectiveness is restricted due \nto their inability to specifically target tumor cells and a \nhigh rate of clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic \nsystem. To overcome such limitations, Creeden et al. \ndeveloped novel engineered “Smart Exosomes” which \nincreased binding ability to αvβ3 on PC cells, resulting \nin enhanced cellular uptake and increased chemotherapy \nresponse in both in vivo and in vitro models [150].\nPCCs-derived exosomes loading with gemcitabine \nexhibited superior results in suppressing tumor growth \nin xenograft mice models than free gemcitabine. More­\nover, compared with free gemcitabine administrated sys­\ntemically, those autologous exosomes specifically carried \ngemcitabine to pancreatic cancer tissue and significantly \ndecreased side effects [151]. Benefiting from the homing \nproperty to parent tumor cells, loading paclitaxel into \nthe exosomes from PANC-1 cell line with surface modi­\nfications could achieve better efficiency than free pacli­\ntaxel [152]. Another recent study suggested that loading \npaclitaxel and gemcitabine monophosphate into the engi­\nneered exosomes might have superior anticancer effects \nthan loading gemcitabine alone [153]. Furthermore, Zhao \net al. established a novel drug delivery system based on \nM1 macrophage-derived exosome, which provided an \neffective therapeutic strategy against drug-resistant pan­\ncreatic cancer [154]. Additionally, exosomes derived from \nbone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have \nnatural anticancer properties via circ_0030167 [141]. \nBM-MSCs exosomes could also be loaded with miR-124, \nwhich targeted EZH2 in PCCs and sensitized pancre­\natic cancer to chemotherapy in vitro and in mice models \n[155]. Recently, Hasoglu et al. firstly reported that pan­\ncreatic islet-derived exosomes can selectively kill pan­\ncreatic cancer cells without harming healthy cells [156]. \nThese advancements underscore the promising potential \nof exosome-based therapies in enhancing the efficacy and \nspecificity of pancreatic cancer treatments.\nEngineered exosomes were promising in immunother­\napy as well [2]. Galectin-9 expressed in PCCs promoted \nM2 phenotype of macrophages and immunosuppression. \nIn the meanwhile, some chemotherapeutic drugs such as \noxaliplatin could induce immunogenic PCCs death and \nactivate antitumor immune response. After loading oxali­\nplatin and antisense oligonucleotides targeting Galec­\ntin-9 into exosomes which were originated from MSCs, \nthey exhibited superior antitumor effects than oxalipla­\ntin and Galectin-9 inhibition alone in mice models with \northotopic tumor [157]. Another recent study showed \nthat loading immunogenic peptides and CCL22 siRNA \ninto exosomes could expand CD8 + T cells and repress \nregulatory T cells within tumor microenvironment \nupon intramuscular administration [158]. In addition, \nprecise photodynamic treatment could also be realized \nvia exosomes. Under photoacoustic imaging guidance, \nengineered exosomes with chlorin e6 (photosensitizer) \ngenerated high amounts of ROS within the tumor. Con­\nsequently, disrupted exosomes membrane components \ncould stimulate the immune system as tumor antigens \n[159]. Given the key role of exosomes in constructing \npremetastatic niches, loading pirfenidone into PCC-\nderived exosomes could alleviate liver fibrosis and sup­\npress liver metastasis [160].\nBesides chemotherapy and immunotherapy, targeted \ntherapy against oncogenic KRAS, the most important \ndriver mutation in pancreatic cancer, has attracting \namounts attention from oncologists and pharmacolo­\ngists for over three decades. Despite the breakthrough of \nKRAS G12C inhibitors in treating non-small-cell lung \ncancer, other KRAS-targeted therapy still has poor clini­\ncal efficacy [161, 162]. Specifically delivering antisense \noligonucleotides or CRISPR/Cas9 via exosomes to tar­\nget mutant KRAS in PCCs may also be a novel way \nto treat pancreatic cancer [163].

Moreover, \na relevant phase I clinical trial is currently activating \n(NCT03608631). Additionally, pancreatic cancer pro­\ngression could also be restrained by other types of engi­\nneered exosomes, such as PCCs-derived Exosomes \nloading with short interfering RNA against P21-activated \nkinase 4 (PAK4) [165], and BM-MSCs loading with miR-\n1231 [166]. Exosome-based treatments for pancreatic \ncancer were summarised in Table 2.\nHowever, there are many challenges of exosome-based \ntherapy at present. Besides therapeutic RNAs and pro­\nteins, engineered exosomes also carried other molecules. \nTherefore, prion particles, oncogenes, and viral miRNAs \nmight be co-delivered to recipient cells, producing side \neffects. Additionally, the normal intercellular communi­\ncation mediated by endogenous exosomes might also be \ninterfered by exogenous exosomes [146]. In general, exo­\nsomes-based therapy is promising but remains further \nstudy.\nExosome characterization techniques\nExtracellular vehicles, including exosomes, can be char­\nacterized using a variety of advanced techniques [167]. \nHigh-resolution imaging methods like scanning elec­\ntron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron micros­\ncopy (TEM), cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), \nand atomic force microscopy (AFM) are used for mor­\nphological characterization to visualize EVs’ structural \nfeatures [168–170]. Proteomic analysis through mass \nspectrometry, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immu­\nnosorbent assay (ELISA) identifies key proteins such as \nCD9, CD63, and CD81 [171], ensuring purity and origin \nassessment. Particle size analysis of exosomes is mainly \nperformed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanopar­\nticle tracking analysis (NTA), and flow cytometry, these \ntechniques measure the size distribution and concentra­\ntion of exosomes, thus further characterizing the physi­\ncal properties of exosomes [172, 173]. The lipidomics \ncharacterization of exosomes is conducted using chro­\nmatography techniques combined with mass spectrom­\netry (LC-MS/MS). This approach enables the analysis of \nthe lipid composition of exosomes, revealing their role in \nthe structure and function of cell membranes [174, 175]. \nTable 2  Overview of exosome-based treatments for pancreatic cancer\nTherapeutic Approach\nExosome Source\nLoading Agent\nKey Findings\nReferences\nChemotherapy\nEnhanced drug delivery\nPCCs-derived exosomes\nGemcitabine\nSuperior tumor suppression, reduced side effects \ncompared to free gemcitabine\n [151]\nEnhanced drug delivery\nPANC-1 cell line \nexosomes\nPaclitaxel\nBetter efficiency than free paclitaxel\n [152]\nCombined drug delivery\nEngineered exosomes\nPaclitaxel and \ngemcitabine \nmonophosphate\nSuperior anticancer effects than gemcitabine alone  [153]\nDrug-resistant cancer \ntherapy\nM1 macrophage-derived \nexosomes\nNot specified\nEffective against drug-resistant pancreatic cancer\n [154]\nAnticancer\nBM-MSCs-derived \nexosomes\nmiR-124\nSensitized pancreatic cancer to chemotherapy\n [155]\nAnticancer\nIslet-derived exosomes\nNot specified\nSuperior anticancer effects without damaging \nhealthy cells\n [156]\nImmunotherapy\nEnhanced immunotherapy\nMSCs-derived exosomes\nOxaliplatin and anti­\nsense oligonucleotides\nSuperior antitumor effects than oxaliplatin and \nGalectin-9 inhibition alone\n [157]\nImmune system \nmodulation\nEngineered exosomes\nImmunogenic pep­\ntides and CCL22 siRNA\nExpanded CD8 + T cells, repressed regulatory T cells \nin the tumor microenvironment\n [158]\nPhotodynamic treatment\nEngineered exosomes\nChlorin e6\nHigh ROS generation within tumor, stimulated \nimmune system as tumor antigens\n [159]\nTargeted Therapy\nOncogenic KRAS targeting\nMSCs-derived exosomes\nShort interfering RNA\nSuppressed tumor growth through targeting KRAS \nG12D\n [112]\nOncogenic KRAS targeting\nPCCs-derived exosomes\nAntisense oligonucle­\notides, CRISPR/Cas9\nPotential novel treatment approach for pancreatic \ncancer\n [163]\nOncogenic KRAS targeting\nMSCs-derived exosomes\nShort interfering RNA\nPhase I clinical trial activating\nNCT03608631\nOther oncogene targeting\nPCCs-derived exosomes\nShort interfering RNA \nagainst PAK4\nSuppressed pancreatic cancer progression\n [165]\nOther oncogene targeting\nBM-MSCs-derived \nexosomes\nmiR-1231\nSuppressed pancreatic cancer progression\n [166]"}, {"page_number": 13, "text": "Page 13 of 18\nQin et al. Cancer Cell International          (2024) 24:264 \nEmerging techniques, such as single-exosome detection \nmethods, are also being developed to enhance the pre­\ncision and detail of exosome analysis [174, 176]. Nota­\nbly, innovative isolation techniques such as microfluidic \ntechnology, immunoaffinity capture, and resistive pulse \nsensing have been highlighted [177, 178]. These methods \noffer higher purity and specificity in isolating extracel­\nlular vesicles, thereby improving the reliability of subse­\nquent analyses.\nWhen applying these characterization techniques to \ndifferent tissue types, the extraction methods may need \nto be adjusted based on the tissue’s specific properties. \nFor example, the dense nature of pancreatic cancer tissue \nrequires modifications to the standard protocols to effec­\ntively isolate exosomes. It is recommended to moderately \nincrease the concentration of collagenase, the shaking \nspeed, and the incubation time when extracting exo­\nsomes from pancreatic cancer tissue compared to other \nreported tissues such as gliomas and melanomas [76, 179, \n180].\nDiscussion\nTumor microenvironment is a highly heterozygous orga­\nnization. Multiple cells and ECM coordinate with each \nother, synergistically promoting pancreatic cancer pro­\ngression. Exosomes are vital mediators to realize rapid \nand abundant communication among different PCCs, \nCAFs, and immune cells within tumor microenviron­\nment. Recently, a novel method showed that pure exo­\nsomes could be effectively isolated from tissues directly \n[181, 182]. Therefore, the role of exosomes in the tumor \nmicroenvironment are ready to be clear in the future \nstudy. Besides that, liquid biopsy via circulating exo­\nsomes is significant in diagnosis and stratifying patients \nto achieve individualized treatment. However, there are \nstill some barriers restraining its clinical application. For \nexample, exosomes could be extracted from blood or \nother body fluid through a variety of methods, such as \nultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography, \nwhich may contribute to unrepeatable results in different \nclinical studies. Therefore, clinical standard in isolating \nexosomes from body fluid remains to be worked out.\nThe development of standardized protocols and meth­\nodologies is paramount to advancing EV research in pan­\ncreatic cancer. Consistent and reproducible results across \ndifferent studies are essential to validate the potential of \nEVs as reliable biomarkers and therapeutic agents [144, \n183]. Current research suffers from variability in isola­\ntion techniques, characterization methods, and analyti­\ncal approaches [183]. Establishing consensus guidelines \nfor these processes will enhance the comparability of data \nand facilitate the translation of EV-based diagnostics and \ntherapies into clinical practice.\nTo validate the diagnostic potential of EV liquid biop­\nsies, multicenter studies with large sample sizes are cru­\ncial [184, 185]. Such studies can provide robust evidence \nof the sensitivity and specificity of EV-derived biomark­\ners in detecting pancreatic cancer at various stages. There \nis also an urgent need to expedite Phase I and Phase II \nclinical trials to assess the safety, efficacy, and optimal \ndelivery methods of engineered exosome-based therapy \n[186, 187]. Early-phase clinical trials will provide criti­\ncal insights into the therapeutic potential of exosome \nand identify any potential challenges that need to be \naddressed before large-scale implementation [188].\nIn addition to exosomes, circulating DNA (cfDNA), \nmetabolites, and circulating RNA (cfRNA) offer comple­\nmentary insights into the tumor microenvironment and \ntumor burden [189, 190]. Combining these biomarkers in \na multi-omics approach can enhance the sensitivity and \nspecificity of liquid biopsies. Utilizing integrated multi-\nomics data models can provide a comprehensive view of \nthe molecular landscape of pancreatic cancer, improving \ndiagnostic accuracy and enabling precise patient stratifi­\ncation for personalized treatment [191].\nConclusion\nExosomes could carry a variety of cargos including pro­\nteins, RNAs, metabolites, mediating the communication \namong heterogeneous cellular components within tumor \nmicroenvironment or even between different organs. The \ntrue potential utility of extracellular vesicles, particularly \nexosomes, lies in their ability to serve as both diagnos­\ntic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Engineered exo­\nsomes are promising to implement targeted therapy, and \ncirculating exosomes in plasma could be detected as liq­\nuid biopsy to accurately diagnose or monitor pancreatic \ncancer patients. However, for this promise to become a \nreality, additional work is needed. Standardization of \nisolation and characterization techniques, large-scale \nmulticenter validation, and early-phase clinical trials are \nessential steps. Combining exosomal biomarkers with \nother biological materials like circulating DNA (cfDNA), \nmetabolites, and circulating RNA (cfRNA) in a multi-\nomics approach can further enhance their clinical utility. \nThese efforts will pave the way for innovative biomarkers \ndiscovery and the development of effective therapeutic \nstrategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in pan­\ncreatic cancer.\nAbbreviations\nPDAC\t\n\u0007Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma\nTME\t\n\u0007Tumor Microenvironment\nEVs\t\n\u0007Extracellular Vesicles\nMVB\t\n\u0007Multivesicular Body\nPCC\t\n\u0007Pancreatic Cancer Cells\nMDSC\t\n\u0007Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells\nDC\t\n\u0007Dendritic Cells\nNK\t\n\u0007Natural Killer cells"}, {"page_number": 14, "text": "Page 14 of 18\nQin et al.

Currently, it is extremely challenging to prevent or detect \nit early enough for effective treatment because patients rarely exhibit symptoms and there are no reliable indicators \nfor detection. Most patients have advanced or spreading cancer that is difficult to treat, and treatments like chemo‑\ntherapy and radiotherapy can only slightly prolong their life by a few months. Immunotherapy has revolutionized \nthe treatment of pancreatic cancer, yet its effectiveness is limited by the tumor’s immunosuppressive and hard-to-\nreach microenvironment. First, this article explains the immunosuppressive microenvironment of pancreatic cancer \nand highlights a wide range of immunotherapy options, including therapies involving oncolytic viruses, modified \nT cells (T-cell receptor [TCR]-engineered and chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T-cell therapy), CAR natural killer cell \ntherapy, cytokine-induced killer cells, immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulators, cancer vaccines, and strate‑\ngies targeting myeloid cells in the context of contemporary knowledge and future trends. Lastly, it discusses the main \nchallenges ahead of pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.\nKeywords  Pancreatic cancer immunotherapy, Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, Adoptive cell therapy, CAR NK \ncell therapy, CAR T-cell therapy, Immune checkpoint blockade, Immune checkpoint inhibitor, Oncolytic virus therapy, \nCancer vaccine\nIntroduction\nPancreatic cancer comprises mostly pancreatic ductal \nadenocarcinoma (PDAC), a persistent and recalcitrant \ndisease [1], and is responsible for an estimated 50,550 \ndeaths in the United States of America in 2023 [2]. Diag-\nnosis in the early stages of metastasis or late-stage is \ncommon since symptoms are often vague. The current \napproach for treating PDAC is standard cytotoxic chem-\notherapy, but it only extends overall survival (OS) by a \nfew months [3–5].\nPDAC carcinogenesis like all the solid tumors is medi-\nated by the gradual build-up of driver mutations, such \nas the oncogene KRAS (G12D mutation) [6–9] and the \ntumor suppressor gene TP53 [10, 11]. These molecular \nmodifications are accompanied by corresponding his-\ntological alterations during different stages of PDAC \ndevelopment [12].

Changes in \nthe surrounding tissue stroma occur as cancer continues \nto advance. The non-transformed tissue stroma, com-\nposed of components such as immunological, vascular, \nand connective tissue, plays a vital role in maintaining \nhomeostasis in response to damage. However, cancer \nexploits these physiological responses to create a favora-\nble tumor microenvironment (TME) for its efficient \ngrowth [12, 14]. Indeed, cancer resembles \"persistent \nwounds\", and alterations in the stroma are the outcome \nof \"abnormal wound healing\" [15].\nImmunotherapeutic strategies possess a significant \ncapability in inducing strong immune responses against \ntumors. \nImmunomodulators, \nimmune \ncheckpoint \nblockade (ICB), and adoptive cell transfer therapy could \npotentially offer hopeful strategies [16–18]. Remarkable \noutcomes have been achieved from 2010 to the present \nthrough clinical research that utilizes various immuno-\ntherapeutic approaches to treat patients with different \ntypes of cancer [19–22]. The immune responses specifi-\ncally targeting cancer cells, triggered by immunotherapy, \ndiffer from those stimulated by tumor-directed therapies. \nFurthermore, these responses can endure for a prolonged \nperiod even after the treatment is discontinued [23, 24]. \nHowever, the application of immunotherapy yields insuf-\nficient results for the vast majority of PDACs. This is pre-\ndominantly attributed to the characteristics of its TME, \nwhich is deficient in effector T cells that have previously \nbeen exposed to antigens [25].\nTumor immunotherapy has revolutionized the treat-\nment of various solid tumors. Nevertheless, current \nimmunotherapies have had limited success in improving \nsurvival for patients with PDAC [26, 27]. The immuno-\nlogical resistance of PDAC to immunotherapies can be \nattributed to its low mutational burden and the hostile \nTME characterized by fibrosis, hypoxia, and immuno-\nsuppression [28–30]. However, a meta-analysis suggested \nthat targeted immunotherapy is more effective than \nstandard treatments in increasing survival and enhanc-\ning immune responses in pancreatic cancer patients [31]. \nMoreover, combining chemotherapy and surgery with \nother immunotherapies may synergistically improve \noutcomes. Various cytotoxic drugs and adjuvant thera-\npies have been shown to sensitize the TME to immuno-\ntherapy by inducing immunogenic cell death, modifying \nevasive immune processes, and reducing immune sup-\npression [32, 33].\nImmunotherapy is presently emerging as a focal point \nin the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This persistent \ntumor primarily escapes immune detection through \nvarious means, including the secretion of immunosup-\npressive factors like transforming growth factor-beta \n(TGF-β), the creation of an immunosuppressive envi-\nronment lacking T lymphocytes, and the expression of \nimmune checkpoints such as programmed death-ligand \n1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 [4, 34]. Furthermore, research is \nbeing conducted on ICB to activate T-cell function in \npancreatic cancer [35–37]. The pancreatic cancer micro-\nenvironment is characterized by extensive desmoplasia, a \nscarcity of effector T lymphocytes, and an immunophe-\nnotype dominated by T helper 2 (TH2) cells, all of which \nfacilitate the evasion of cancer cells from immune sur-\nveillance [38–40]. Consequently, monoclonal antibodies \n(mAbs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-\n1) and PD-L1 have shown limited efficacy [4]. Moreover, \nimmunotherapies like PD-1 inhibition may benefit only a \nsmall percentage of cancer patients (3%) who have hyper-\nmutation and microsatellite instability [41].\nThis article delves headfirst into a comprehensive anal-\nysis of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in \npancreatic cancer. In the context of contemporary knowl-\nedge and future trends, the article elaborates on a wide \nrange of immunotherapies, such as oncolytic virus ther-\napy (OVT), adoptive cell transfer therapy including T-cell \nreceptor (TCR)-engineered T cells therapy, chimeric \nantigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, CAR natural killer \n(NK) cell therapy, and cytokine-induced killer cells. Addi-\ntionally, it examines immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) \nand immunomodulators, cancer vaccines, and immuno-\ntherapeutic approaches that target myeloid cells. Lastly, \nthe article highlights the effects of the gut microbiome \nin modulating response to ICIs and the emerging role of \nCRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology in pancreatic can-\ncer immunotherapy. Finally, it discusses the main chal-\nlenges ahead of pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.\nExploring the tumor microenvironment (TME) \nof pancreatic cancer\nThe complicated interaction between tumor cells and \ntheir adjacent microenvironment significantly impacts \nthe development of solid tumors. Determining the out-\ncome of cancer, whether it progresses or regresses, heav-\nily relies on the immune environment present in tumors. \nThis environment is made up of various cell types such \nas adaptive immune cells, macrophages, dendritic cells \n(DCs), NK cells, and other innate immune cells [42]. \nPDAC serves as a prime example of the various types of \ncommunication that can occur between tumors and sur-\nrounding tissue. PDAC demonstrates strong resistance to \nnew immunotherapies due to the exclusive collaboration \nbetween different immune cells, resulting in the creation \nof a highly immunosuppressive setting that aids tumor \nadvancement [12, 43–46]. The \"cold\" TME is a distinct \nfeature of a pancreatic tumor wherein a considerable \ninfiltration of myeloid cells is observed, and ­CD8+ T cells"}, {"page_number": 3, "text": "Page 3 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n\t\nare usually absent, resulting in immunological character-\nistics [47]. Given the heterogeneous nature of pancreatic \nTME, components may have dual, contradicting roles \n(Table 1). In this section, we outline the involvement of \nimmune cells and non-immune cells in the TME of pan-\ncreatic cancer and cross-talk between these cells (Figs. 1 \nand 2).\nThe role of immune cells\nThe TME comprises various immune cells, each with dis-\ntinct roles and significance. This section will elucidate the \nfunctions of these immune cells within the TME.\nRole of T lymphocytes in TME\nThe immunological diversity among tumors in patients \nwith PDAC is wide-ranging, characterized by varying \ndensities of infiltrating T-cells and the composition of \nT-cell subpopulations [48–51]. The presence of desmo-\nplastic elements might not influence the accumulation \nof T cells, thus revealing a separate spatial arrangement \nof T cells in PDAC [50]. This challenges the idea that the \ninhibitory environment shaped by fibroblasts and desmo-\nplastic stroma suppresses the infiltration of T cells [52, \n53]. In pancreatic tumors, the extravasation of T cells is \nconstrained by the desmoplastic stroma [54], leading to \nimmune exclusion, the induction of immunosuppression, \nand the inefficacy of anti-cancer therapies [55].\nThe presence of more ­CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes \n(CTLs) encircling cancerous cells is associated with a \nboost in the survival rates of patients [50]. According to \nthe study, in patients who had a better survival, tumor \nsamples exhibited a greater percentage of ­CD8+ T cells, \nbut a lesser percentage of ­CD4+ T cells compared to \ntumor samples from patients with a short survival [51]. \nThese results highlight the complexity of the immune \nresponse in PDAC and raise questions about the role of \nthe TME in shaping immune profiles. Further investiga-\ntion is needed to fully understand these findings and their \nimplications for future treatments. In the subsequent dis-\ncourse, we explicate the pivotal contribution of T cells in \nthe TME according to distinct T cell phenotypes.\nCytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)  The principal partici-\npants in the battle against cancer cells are the CTLs that \nproduce IFN-γ, TNF, perforin, and granzymes. These \nCTLs are responsible for generating durable memory \ncells that grant protection against cancer cells in the times \nto come. CTLs can recognize and kill tumor cells that \nexpress cognate tumor antigens. This specific recognition \nis achieved through the interaction between the TCR on \nCTLs and the peptide-major histocompatibility complex \n(MHC) on the tumor cell surface. Once the recognition \noccurs, CTLs induce the death of the target cell through \napoptosis [56].\nPrevious research has demonstrated that the prognosis \nof individuals diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is influ-\nenced by the distribution of ­CD8+ TILs [57]. Increased \nsurvival in pancreatic cancer is associated with an eleva-\ntion in the quantity of ­CD8+ T lymphocytes found within \nthe tumor tissue [35, 50, 51]. Furthermore, in prior inves-\ntigations involving surgically removed samples from \npancreatic cancer cases, it has been observed that the \nquantity of ­CD8+ T cells located in the TME exhibited \na positive association with the survival rate of patients \n[57–60]. Early mortality related to pancreatic cancer was \ncorrelated with the percentage of ­CD8+ T cells in the \nperipheral region [61].\nThe dysfunction and exhaustion of ­CD8+ CTLs \nwithin tumors is characterized by both a decline in \nTable 1  Dual role of key components of pancreatic tumor microenvironment\nCAF: Cancer-associated fibroblast, ECM: Extracellular matrix, PanIN: Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PDAC: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, TAMs: Tumor-\nassociated macrophages, TILs: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes\nComponent\nPro-tumor effects\nAnti-tumor/limiting effects\nT lymphocytes\nCD4+ T cell supported cancer progression by secreting IL-17 \nand IL-27 [551, 552]\nCytotoxic TILs induced tumor regression [553, 554]\nRegulatory T \nlymphocytes \n(Tregs)\nTreg suppressed immunity against early stage pancreatic \nintraepithelial neoplasms [555]\nTreg depletion led to accelerated tumor progression [104]\nB lymphocytes\nB cells supported tumor progression/proliferation by secreting \nIL-35 and activating immunosuppressive TAMs [556, 557]\nInsufficient data\nMyeloid cells\nCD11b+ myeloid cells are required for oncogenic Kras-driven \nPanIN formation [165, 166, 558]\nReinvigorating dysregulated myeloid cells in therapeutic settings \n(e.g., using CD40 agonist) [130, 407, 431, 559]\nCAF\nRegulating tumor metabolism for cancer cell proliferation \nand suppressing anti-tumor immunity [35, 560–563]\nIncreased matrix deposition and forming a dense and stiff matrix \naround early PDAC cells [242, 564, 565]\nECM\nSupporting cancer cell proliferation and migration [566, 567]\nCancer-cell-derived fibrillar collagen and type I collagen restrains \ntumor growth [568, 569]"}, {"page_number": 4, "text": "Page 4 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

Additionally, there are changes to \ntheir gene expression patterns. According to a model \nstudying pancreatic cancer, the signaling of the IL-18 \nreceptor is responsible for regulating the exhaustion of \ntumor-targeting ­CD8+ T lymphocytes. This occurs by \nactivating the IL-2/STAT5/mTOR pathway [62].

TH1 cells strengthen the immune response of type \nI immune cells by promoting the activation, proliferation, \nand mobilization of CTLs, M1 macrophages, and NK \ncells. This immune reaction aids in defending the body \nagainst intracellular infections and tumor cells. These cells \nexpress the T-box transcription factor TBX21 (T-bet) and \nare responsible for generating anti-cancer elements such \nas IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α [64].

This is because IFN-γ has \nthe potential to elevate the expression of PD-L1 in cancer \ncells, thereby hindering the effectiveness of anti-tumor \nimmunity [66]. Murine models of PDAC demonstrate that \nTH1 cells play a crucial role in providing defense against \ntumors, while in human cases, these cells are linked with \nextended survival [67].\nMicrobial dysbiosis and the disruption of epithelial \nbarrier function are considered inducing factors in the \nneoplastic transformation [68, 69]. In this regard, the \ncontribution of the microbiome to the development of \npancreatic cancer and drug resistance of PDAC has been \nrecognized [70, 71].

There has been an associa-\ntion made between the activation of DCs and the induc-\ntion of TH2 responses, and it is specifically linked to the \nthymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which is classi-\nfied as a cytokine similar to IL-7 [64]. The prevalence of \n­GATA3+ TH2 cell infiltration surpasses the occurrence \nof T-bet+ TH1 cell infiltration in pancreatic cancer. The \ndevelopment of the disease is associated with a higher \nratio of ­GATA3+/T-bet+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes \n(TILs) [72, 73]. IL-4 enhances the growth of pancreatic \ncancer cells in humans [74]. Additionally, a worse OS rate \nis observed in patients suffering from PDAC character-\nized by a higher concentration of TH2 cytokines in their \nbloodstream [74]. Likewise, poor survival is linked with \nTH2-induced inflammation in individuals suffering from \npancreatic cancer [75]. However, a study reported that \nthe inhibition of pancreas cancer growth occurs when \nTH2 cells enhance the anti-tumorigenic responses of \nmacrophages and eosinophils [76].\nGiven the fact that ligation of Toll-like receptor 4 \n(TLR4) could potentially heighten inflammation in the \npancreas, it can be postulated that the activation of TLR4 \nmay play a pivotal role in the onset of pancreatic cancer. \nAn investigation demonstrated that DCs evoke ­CD4+ \nTH2 cells for pancreatic antigens, thereby advancing \nthe transition from pancreatitis to cancer. Moreover, the \nrestraint of MyD88 is accountable for inducing these out-\ncomes [77].\nType 17 T helper (TH17) The commitment to the \nTH17 cell lineage begins with the action of TGF-β and \nIL-6, and this lineage is sustained by IL-23 while being \nstrengthened by the autocrine production of IL-21. The \ncrucial factors RORγt and STAT3 are necessary for the \ndevelopment of TH17 cells and the expression of IL-17 \ncytokines. TH17 cells play an important role in main-\ntaining mucosal barriers and contributing to pathogen \nclearance at mucosal surfaces [64]. Elevated quantities of \nTH17 lymphocytes have been observed in multiple types \nof human malignancies, such as ovarian, pancreatic, kid-\nney, and gastric cancer [78–80]. According to several \ninvestigations, the existence of augmented levels of TH17 \ncells in tumor tissues or peripheral blood is linked to the \nprogression of cancer [81, 82]. The aggressive form of \nthe disease was found to be associated with a significant \nincrease in the quantity of IL-17 produced by ­CD4+ TILs \n[83]. Conversely, alternative studies propose contrast-\ning results and indicate that TH17 cells might possess a \nstrong anti-tumor impact, as they are present in individ-\nuals with restricted disease or those who have survived \nfor an extensive period of time [84, 85]. Indeed, there is \nan ongoing debate regarding the involvement of ­CD4+ \nTH17 cells in cancer [86].\nIL-17A plays a significant role in PDAC by assisting \nin the early stages of cancer development [87, 88], con-\ntrolling the characteristics of PDAC cancer stem cells \n(CSCs) [89], advancing tumor growth [83, 88, 90], and \ncausing resistance to checkpoint inhibitors through the \nformation of NETs [91]. Additionally, recent studies have \nrevealed that IL-17A affects the transcriptome of can-\ncer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [92]. Prominently, the \ninduction of CAFs that are inflammatory is promoted by \nT cells that produce IL-17A, thus contributing to the pro-\ngression of PDAC [93]. The promotion of tumorigenesis \nis facilitated by the upregulation of B7-H4 through IL-17/\nIL-17 receptor signaling in the pancreatic epithelium \n[94]. These findings accentuate the role of TH17 cells in \nfavor of pancreatic cancer progression.\nContrary to the aforementioned findings, there exist \nfindings demonstrating that TH17 cells act against tumor \ncells. Enhancing survival in a murine model of pancre-\natic cancer is observed through the promotion of TH17 \ncell development within the TME [95]. All in all, the role \nof TH17 and IL-17A in pancreatic cancer is not yet fully \nunderstood, with evidence suggesting both pro-tumo-\nrigenic and anti-tumorigenic effects. Further research \nis needed to elucidate the mechanisms through which \nIL-17A influences pancreatic cancer progression and to \ndetermine the potential therapeutic implications of tar-\ngeting IL-17A in this disease.\nRegulatory T cells (Tregs)  Tregs express CD4, CD25, \nand a chief transcription factor, called forkhead box P3 \n(FOXP3). The prevention of autoimmune disorders, the \nlimitation of chronic inflammatory diseases, and the \nmaintenance of peripheral tolerance all hinge upon Tregs. \nFurthermore, Tregs play a crucial role in the tumor envi-\nronment, influencing cancer progression and immune \nresponses [96]. Tregs can exert their suppressive effects \nthrough various mechanisms, whether by direct contact \nor independently. These mechanisms include: The pro-\nduction of suppressive cytokines such as TGF-β, IL-10, \nand IL-35. The engagement of inhibitory immune check-\npoints and enzymes, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-\nassociated protein 4 (CTLA-4), PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, T \ncell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), \nCD39, CD73, and IDO. The induction of direct cytotoxic-\nity through the release of perforin/granzyme. The disrup-\ntion of T effector cell activity through metabolic altera-\ntions, specifically IL-2 consumption. The initiation of a \ntolerogenic environment by inducing tolerogenic DCs, \nwhich then facilitates T cell exhaustion [97–99].\nIn the peripheral blood and TME, individuals suf-\nfering from pancreatic cancer exhibit an increased \nfrequency of Tregs [100, 101]. Tregs play a part in con-\ntrolling the immune response as PDAC advances from"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "Page 7 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n\t\na premalignant state to a cancerous stage. The presence \nof elevated Tregs is linked to a more unfavorable prog-\nnosis in PDAC [102]. Tregs possess the ability to restrict \nthe proliferation and immunogenicity of DCs in pancre-\natic cancer. Additionally, the stimulation of anti-tumor \nimmunity in pancreatic cancer is achieved by diminishing \nTregs in a manner that relies on ­CD8+ -activated T-cells \n[103]. Contrariwise, the depletion of Tregs shapes the \nTME, leading to an acceleration of pancreatic carcino-\ngenesis [104]. There is an expansion of pro-inflammatory \nand immunosuppressive Tregs which simultaneously \nexpress RORγt and FOXP3 [105]. The underlying ration-\nale for this dual functionality can be elucidated as follows: \nthe presence of plasticity within the pancreatic cancer \nmicroenvironment enables the Tregs to exhibit the char-\nacteristic phenotype of TH17 cells.\nRole of NK cells in TME\nNK cells, which are a distinct type of immune cell found \nin the innate immune system, are believed to play a role \nin monitoring and controlling tumor growth and tumor \nimmunosurveillance [106, 107]. Both preclinical and clin-\nical studies have demonstrated a link between decreased \nNK cell activity and an increased susceptibility to cancer \nas well as a higher chance of cancer spread and metasta-\nsis [108–110]. Researchers have identified several media-\ntors, including indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), \nmatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), TGF-β, and IL-10, \nthat contribute to immune suppression in pancreatic \ncancer, impeding the ability of NK cells to recognize and \neliminate tumor cells [28].\nThe survival of individuals with PDAC was found to \nbe positively correlated with the relative frequency of \nNK cells in their blood. However, PDAC-associated NK \ncells demonstrated lower cytotoxicity compared to those \nof healthy participants [111]. Patients with PDAC were \nobserved to have diminished expression of NKG2D, \nNKp46, and NKp30 on their peripheral NK cells, which \nwas connected to the patient’s stage and histological \ngrade [112]. Furthermore, the decreased expression of \nCD96 and CD226 (key regulators of NK cell function) \non NK cells was linked to the development of cancer in \nPDAC patients [113]. Additionally, the evasion of NK \ncells in human pancreatic cancer is associated with the \nexpression of Igγ-1 chain C region (IGHG1). Mechanis-\ntically, the presence of IGHG1 suppressed the cytotoxic \nactivity of NK cells by inhibiting antibody-dependent \ncellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [114]. Moreover, impaired \nlocalization resulting from the absence of CXCR2 and \nimpaired tumor cytotoxicity contributed to NK cell \nimmune evasion in patients with pancreatic cancer [115]. \nThe function of NK cells is inhibited in the microenviron-\nment of human PDAC by activated pancreatic stellate \ncells [116]. In pancreatic cancer, the orchestration of \nanti-tumor immune responses through CXCL8 (IL-8) by \nradiotherapy is reliant on NK cells. In xenografted mice, \nthe use of high-dose radiotherapy in conjunction with \nadoptive NK cell transfer resulted in enhanced tumor \ncontrol compared to using either treatment alone, indi-\ncating that combining NK cells with radiotherapy is a \nlogical approach for cancer therapy [117]. Inhibiting the \nprotein growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6), which is gener-\nated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and \nCAFs within the TME of PDAC, reverses the process of \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances \nthe activation of NK cells [118].\nRole of DCs in TME\nDCs, which are crucial for effective anti-tumor T cell \nresponses, are scarce in the pancreatic tumor environ-\nment and are usually found at the tumor edges [119]. An \nincreased presence of type-1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) \nwithin the entire tumor area and the tumor stroma was \nnotably linked to improved disease-free survival (DFS). \nFurthermore, a rise in the number of cDC2s infiltrating \nthe tumor’s epithelial layer was associated with enhanced \nDFS and OS [120]. Furthermore, patients with pancre-\natic cancer have been shown to have lower levels of DCs \nin their blood [121]. Interestingly, higher levels of cir-\nculating DCs are linked to better survival rates in these \npatients [121, 122]. Additionally, the surgical removal \nof the pancreatic tumor has been found to enhance the \nfunction of blood DCs, suggesting that the tumor itself \nmay influence immune function [123, 124].\nCytokines originating from tumors, including TGF-\nβ, IL-10, and IL-6, have been identified as factors that \ninhibit the survival and growth of DCs [125]. MDSCs \ngenerate nitric oxide (NO) and obstruct the activation \nof DCs [126]. In pancreatic tumors, T-cell dysfunction \nis common, and improving DC-mediated T-cell activa-\ntion could be key for treatment. Dysfunction of cDC1s in \nPDACs leads to unresponsiveness to checkpoint immu-\nnotherapy. A study of 106 samples from PDAC patients \nshowed decreased levels of circulating cDC2s, which was \nlinked to poor prognosis. Elevated levels of IL-6 in PDAC \npatients were found to negatively impact DC numbers \nand differentiation. This suggests that inflammatory \ncytokines suppress DCs, impairing antitumor immunity \n[127].\nDCs control T cells via cross-priming (cross-presen-\ntation). It is an open question in PDAC whether boost-\ning the cross-priming capacity of DCs can enhance the \nT cells’ anti-tumor activity and remodel the TME. In the \nprocess of cross-priming, foreign antigens are absorbed \nby APCs, processed, and then displayed on MHC-I. This \nsequence of events ultimately triggers the activation of"}, {"page_number": 8, "text": "Page 8 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n­CD8+ T-cell responses [128]. Research has shown that \nthe cross-priming of cDC1 is not only necessary for start-\ning ­CD8+ T-cell responses as tumors progress, but it also \nhas a pivotal role in the reactivation of tumor-specific \n­CD8+ T cells through immunotherapy, leading to tumor \nshrinkage [129]. However, during the development of \npancreatic cancer, the maturation of cDC1 is increasingly \nand universally hindered [130], impairing cross-presenta-\ntion machinery. As a first proof of concept, a study tested \nwhether cross-presentation by DCs could activate pan-\ncreatic tumor-specific ­CD8+ T cells in vaccinated pancre-\natic cancer patients. The process of in vivo cross-priming \nleads to the activation of mesothelin (MSLN)-specific \n­CD8+ T cells in patients who received a vaccine for allo-\ngeneic pancreatic tumors. Also, the vaccine recruits DCs \nthat cross-prime and generate MSLN-specific ­CD8+ T \ncells, which are capable of destroying tumor cells express-\ning MSLN [131]. All in all, the immunosuppressive pan-\ncreatic TME leads to the disruption of the cross-priming \nability of DCs. Thus, finding solutions to reinvigorate \nthe DCs to cross-prime tumor antigens paves the way \nfor developing novel therapies that boost the anti-tumor \nimmune response mediated by ­CD8+ T cells.\nRole of macrophages in TME\nMonocytes in circulation are drawn towards the TME \nand transform into macrophages, called TAMs, when \nexposed to cytokines, chemokines, and various stimuli, \nincluding high levels of concentration of hypoxia and \nlactic acid [132–134]. Several studies revealed that the \nCCL2/CCR2 and CXCL17/CXCR8 axes are involved \nin recruiting monocytes into the site of inflammation \nand tumor [135, 136]. TAMs display diverse polariza-\ntion states called functional states. A wide range of TAM \nsubpopulations has been discovered and is continuously \ngrowing. They are commonly classified as “M1” and “M2” \nmacrophages. M1 macrophages, as typically described, \ngenerate pro-inflammatory cytokines with mainly anti-\nneoplastic impacts, whereas M2 macrophages produce \nanti-inflammatory signals that potentially accelerate \ntumor development [137–140]. The presence of tissue-\nresident macrophages in PDAC is a result of their origin \nfrom embryonic hematopoiesis, and these macrophages \nplay a crucial role in advancing the progression of tumors \n[141].\nA range of scientific investigations on various tumor \ntypes, including pancreatic cancer, have demonstrated \na contrary association between the invasion of TAMs \nand the prognosis of patients [133, 142–144]. Multiple \nresearch groups have confirmed that TAMs are respon-\nsible for fostering immunosuppression, angiogenesis, \nand the growth of tumors in mouse models of PDAC. \nTheir mechanism involves the release of growth fac-\ntors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), \ncytokines, and proteases [145–149]. Within the PDAC \nmicroenvironment, the presence of granulocyte–mac-\nrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and \nlactate plays a crucial function in the polarization of \nTAMs, which are molecules discharged from cancer \ncells in a manner reliant on a mutant KRAS. A study \nhas shown that TAM gene expression and metabo-\nlism are adversely affected by GM-CSF, disrupting \ntheir regulation through PI3K-AKT pathway signaling \n[150]. Collagen turnover in pancreatic cancer causes \nmetabolic reprogramming of TAMs, leading to the \npromotion of fibrosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) \nremodeling [151].\nThe effectiveness of treatment in PDAC can be sig-\nnificantly reduced by TAMs. TAMs impact the func-\ntion of cytidine deaminase, which is a critical enzyme \nin the metabolism of gemcitabine. This, in turn, leads to \nresistance to gemcitabine-based treatments in animal \nmodels of PDAC [152]. In mice models of PDAC, the \nsuppression of C–C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) \npromotes T-cell infiltration, enhances the efficacy of \nradiotherapy and chemotherapy, and diminishes metas-\ntasis by preventing the migration of monocytes to the \nTME [153–155]. Also, the combination of CCR2 and \nCXCR2 inhibitors can interrupt the accumulation of \n­CCR2+ TAMs and ­CXCR2+ tumor-associated neutro-\nphils (TANs) in the TME and enhance the effectiveness \nof chemotherapy in treating PDAC [147]. Moreover, \nthe expression of CXCR2 is also reported on TAMs \n[156, 157]. For example, in Pten-null prostate tumors, \n­CXCR2+ TAMs are abundant. Activating CXCR2 shifts \nthese macrophages to an anti-inflammatory state, but \nblocking CXCR2 with a selective antagonist repro-\ngrams them to a pro-inflammatory state [156]. Also, \nin pancreatic cancer mouse models, ­CXCR2+CD68+ \nmacrophages (M2 phenotype) are recruited to the TME \nby tumor-derived CXCL8, where they contribute to \nlocal immunosuppression, thereby reducing the effec-\ntiveness of PD-1 blockade therapy [157]. Thus, block-\ning the CXCR2 pathway offers a therapeutic option \nfor enhancing cancer immunotherapy in PDAC. In a \nstudy, the tumor burden, M2 macrophage polarization, \nand migration are reduced, and the response to immu-\nnotherapy with anti-PD-1 is enhanced by ladarixin, a \nCXCR1/2 dual-inhibitor [158]. In pancreatic cancer \nmodels, the reprogramming of TAMs through colony-\nstimulating factor 1 (CSF1)/colony-stimulating factor 1 \nreceptor (CSF-1R) blockade enhances the response to \nT-cell checkpoint immunotherapy [159]."}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "Page 9 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n\t\nRole of myeloid‑derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in TME\nMDSCs, a diverse group of immature myeloid cells, \nare commonly categorized into two types: monocytic \n(M-MDSC) \nand \ngranulocytic \n(polymorphonuclear \n[PMN]-MDSC). M-MDSCs closely resemble monocytes \nin terms of their phenotype and physical characteris-\ntics, while PMN-MDSCs are equivalent to neutrophils. \nMDSCs play a paramount role in cancer progression \nby promoting immunosuppression, shaping the TME, \nand facilitating the formation of pre-metastatic niches. \nWithin the microenvironment of human tumors, MDSCs \nare abundant, and typically, PMN-MDSCs make up more \nthan 80% of all MDSCs associated with tumors [160, \n161]. Furthermore, in the circulation of the portal vein, \nthe survival and immunoresistance of PDAC circulating \ntumor cells are supported by influencing the differentia-\ntion of MDSCs [162].\nThe levels of MDSCs in human PDAC are associated \nwith the stage of cancer [143, 163, 164]. GM-CSF, pro-\nduced by tumor cells at the early stages of cancer, plays \na crucial role in the recruitment and differentiation of \nMDSCs, as confirmed by studies on genetically modified \nmice [165, 166]. CD73 causes the acceleration of pan-\ncreatic cancer pathogenesis by inducing T cell suppres-\nsion through GM-CSF/MDSC [167]. Additionally, the \nreceptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) \nfacilitates the accumulation of MDSCs and promotes \npancreatic carcinogenesis [168]. High expression levels of \nYes-associated protein (YAP) or MDSC-associated genes \nindicate poor survival in PDAC patients. YAP expression \nlevels are significantly correlated with a gene signature \nassociated with MDSCs in primary human PDAC [169]. \nFollowing the mutation of KRAS, the transcription reg-\nulator YAP, as a downstream molecule of the oncogenic \nKRAS, plays a crucial role in the neoplastic development \nleading to PDAC [170]. The interaction between YAP/\nTAZ (downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway) and \nTEAD proteins facilitates the cancer-promoting func-\ntions of YAP. Thus, small-molecule inhibitors like GNE-\n7883 and IAG933, which block the interactions between \nYAP/TAZ and TEAD, can disrupt oncogenic YAP/TAZ \nsignaling in RAS-altered tumors like PDAC [171, 172]. \nWithin the PDAC microenvironment, CD200, a regula-\ntor of myeloid cell function, is upregulated. Moreover, \nMDSCs from PDAC patients show increased expression \nof the CD200 receptor. CD200 expression may regulate \nthe development of MDSCs in the microenvironment of \nPDAC [173].\nMDSCs control the inhibition of tumor activity in \n­CD4+ and ­CD8+ T lymphocytes. T-cell activation is \nrepressed by PD-L1, which is upregulated by MDSCs \nthrough the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction [174]. Furthermore, \nin an interleukin-10 (IL-10)-dependent manner, MDSCs \ncan limit T-cell activity by promoting the growth of \nimmune-suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) through \nthe release of TGF-β and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) [175, \n176]. MDSCs play a significant role in both primary and \nacquired resistance to cancer immunotherapy [177]. In \nPDAC, reducing MDSCs enhances the accumulation \nof stimulated ­CD8+ T lymphocytes within the tumor, \nleading to cell death in tumor epithelial cells and remod-\neling of the tumor stroma [178]. Strategic MDSC target-\ning has been observed to effectively revitalize cytotoxic \nanti-tumor responses in PDAC cases. This mechanism \ninduces the repolarization of TAMs and instigates the \nactivation of the inflammasome machinery, thereby lead-\ning to the production of IL-18. The subsequent upregula-\ntion of IL-18 notably amplifies the functional capabilities \nof T-cells and NK cells within the TME [179]. In conclu-\nsion, targeting MDSCs presents a promising approach \nto the treatment of PDAC, and it has shown positive \neffects in revitalizing cytotoxic anti-tumor responses and \nenhancing the functional capabilities of T cells and NK \ncells. Therefore, further research into MDSC targeting \ncould potentially lead to more effective therapeutic strat-\negies for PDAC.\nRole of neutrophils in TME\nNeutrophils act as the first line of protection in the body \nagainst infection and respond to a broad range of pro-\ninflammatory signals and alarmins, such as cancer cells. \nThese cells possess adaptability or plasticity, allowing \nthem to adjust their actions when faced with different \ninflammatory triggers [180]. Because of the inflamma-\ntory state of the TME in PDAC, tumor cells secrete pro-\ninflammatory substances like tumor necrosis factor-alpha \n(TNF-α) and IL-12, causing the recruitment of neutro-\nphils to the location of the tumor [181]. Factors secreted \nby tumor cells can attract neutrophils. Neutrophils can \nbe drawn in by IL-1, CD200, CXCR2 ligands (like CXCL1 \n[in human and mouse], CXCL2 [in human and mouse], \nCXCL5 [in human], and CXCL8 [in human]) [182], GM-\nCSF (in human), granulocyte colony-stimulating fac-\ntor (G-CSF; in human and mouse), and various other \nsubstances. These factors are released by tumor cells to \nattract neutrophils [182–184]. There exists a notable cor-\nrelation between shortened survival and worse prognosis \nin patients with PDAC and increased quantities of neu-\ntrophils infiltrating the TME [60, 185].\nThe roles of neutrophils in the TME vary depending on \ntheir polarization states, either promoting or suppressing \ncancer growth. TME attracts TANs through the action \nof cytokines and chemokines. TANs can be categorized \nbased on their activation and cytokine profile, which \ndetermines their impact on the growth of tumor cells. \nN1 TANs exhibit a beneficial effect on tumor suppression"}, {"page_number": 10, "text": "Page 10 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \neither through direct cytotoxicity or indirect means. N2 \nTANs, on the other hand, promote immunosuppres-\nsion, tumor expansion, angiogenesis, and metastasis \nby causing DNA instability and releasing cytokines and \nchemokines [186]. Recently, a new type of TANs called \nT3 neutrophils has been discovered. These T3 neutro-\nphils stimulate angiogenesis, thus improving the abil-\nity of pancreatic tumors to survive in low-oxygen and \nnutrient-deficient environments [187]. Identifying the \nplasticity of N1/N2 neutrophils has been deemed a criti-\ncal prognostic marker, potentially demonstrating TME \nand immune evasion in PDAC patients [188]. Neutro-\nphils with anti-tumor properties can directly eliminate \ntumor cells through the production of reactive oxygen \nand nitrogen species. Additionally, they have the ability \nto activate T cells and attract pro-inflammatory M1 mac-\nrophages. Conversely, neutrophils that aid tumor devel-\nopment secrete MMP-9, facilitating the growth of new \nblood vessels and the dissemination of tumor cells. These \nneutrophils can also hinder the function of NK cells \nwhile recruiting anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages \nand Tregs. Further, suppressor neutrophils, referred to as \nPMN-MDSCs, as well as other pro-tumoral neutrophils, \nimpede the activity of ­CD8+ T cells [24, 180]. The growth \nof pancreatic cancer is reduced and the effectiveness of \nICB treatment with anti-PD-1 is enhanced through the \ninhibition of TANs by lorlatinib [189]. The metastasis \nof pancreatic cancer is facilitated by neutrophils that \ninfiltrate as a result of chemotherapy. This is achieved \nthrough the activation of the Gas6/AXL signaling path-\nway [184].\nNeutrophils differentiate themselves from other \nimmune cells by producing neutrophil extracellular \ntraps (NETs), consisting of DNA fibers and proteolytic \nenzymes released to counteract infections [190]. Never-\ntheless, recent studies have suggested that NETs might \ncontribute to cancer metastasis. By examining a PDAC \nmouse model, researchers investigated the effects of \nDNase I, a NET inhibitor, and observed a reduction in \nliver metastasis [191]. In the PDAC milieu, neutrophil \nrecruitment and NETosis are triggered by IL-17 [91]. The \nactivation of the IL-1β/epidermal growth factor receptor \n(EGFR)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) path-\nway is prompted by NETs, resulting in the promotion of \nmigration, invasion, and EMT of pancreatic cancer cells \n[192].\nRole of B lymphocytes in TME\nA study found that a high density of B cells within ter-\ntiary lymphoid tissues of human PDAC is associated with \nlonger survival rates, germinal center immune signature, \nand ­CD8+ TILs infiltration [193]. In the TME of PDAC, \nthe predominant B cells are plasma cells and memory \nB cells, which exhibit high levels of CD27 expression. \nHowever, numerous studies have discovered that the \nupregulation of CXCL13, triggered by IL-1β and type I \ninterferons (IFNs-I), leads to an increased influx of regu-\nlatory B cells (Bregs) that perform immunosuppressive \nactivities [194–196]. Bregs can activate STAT3 signaling \nwithin themselves and ­CD8+ T cells via IL-35. This acti-\nvation leads to two distinct effects: firstly, the transcrip-\ntional regulator BCL-6 experiences an increase in naive \nB cells, which interferes with the transformation of B \ncells into plasma cells; secondly, the operational capac-\nity of CTLs is suppressed [197, 198]. Recent research \ndiscovered that the resistance to the stimulator of inter-\nferon genes (STING) agonists in PDAC is attributed to \nthe induction of IL-35+ B cell proliferation. The systemic \napplication of anti-IL-35 and STING agonist (cyclic \nguanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate \n[cGAMP]) can work together to suppress the amplifi-\ncation of Bregs and boost the effectiveness of NK cells \n[199]. A clinical trial showed that ibrutinib (a Bruton \ntyrosine kinase inhibitor) plus nab-paclitaxel/gemcit-\nabine did not improve OS or progression-free survival \n(PFS) for patients with PDAC [200].\nThe role of non‑immune cells\nWithin the microenvironment of pancreatic tumors, \nthere exists a variety of non-immune cells. This section \ndelves into a discussion about the most significant among \nthem.\nPancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs)\nPCSCs are a subset of cancer cells that exhibit stem cell-\nlike characteristics, including the ability to self-renew \nand initiate tumorigenesis. They are believed to contrib-\nute to the initiation, metastasis, and recurrence of PDAC, \nand are also responsible for resistance to chemotherapy \nand radiation. PCSCs express several markers, including \nCD133, CD24, CD44, microtubule-associated double-\ncortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), CXCR4, epithelial-specific \nantigen (ESA), OCT4, nestin, and ABCB1 [201, 202]. In \nPDAC, stem cells display unusual activation of multiple \nsignaling pathways that are generally active in embryonic \ngrowth. This irregular signaling via mechanisms such as \nHedgehog, Wnt, Notch, JAK-STAT, Nodal/Activin, and \nHippo enables PCSCs to preserve their self-renewal abil-\nity, develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, \nenhance their capacity to induce tumors, and spread to \nother parts of the body [202]. A specific subpopulation of \nCSCs, identified by CD133 and CXCR4 markers, is cru-\ncial for tumor metastasis in human pancreatic cancer. \nDepleting this subpopulation can significantly reduce \nmetastasis. Modulating the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis could \nbe a potential strategy to inhibit CSC metastasis [203]."}, {"page_number": 11, "text": "Page 11 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n\t\nThe E2F1/4-pRb/RBL2 axis, which undergoes deregu-\nlation following a KRAS mutation, is instrumental in \nmaintaining equilibrium among signaling pathways con-\ntrolling stem cell-like characteristics of CSCs. This axis \ngoverns the production of Wnt ligands, thereby manag-\ning the self-renewal, resistance to chemotherapy, and \ninvasive nature of PCSCs, along with the proliferation of \nfibroblasts [204]. This axis might be a therapeutic target \nfor eradicating PCSCs.\nMesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs)\nMSCs are a heterogeneous group of progenitor cells that \ntransform into tumor-associated mesenchymal stem \ncells (TA-MSCs) within TME, influencing tumor growth, \nmetastasis, angiogenesis, and treatment responses \nthrough the secretion of various factors, and their immu-\nnosuppressive properties could be targeted to enhance \nanti-tumor immunity [205]. First of all, TA-MSCs can \nrelease CCL2, CCl7, and CCL12 to recruit monocytes, \nmacrophages, MDSCs, and neutrophils [206]. They also \nproduce CXCL9 [207], CXCL10 [207], CXCL11 [207], \ninducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [207], and IDO \n[208], resulting in the inhibition of effector T cells. Mech-\nanistically, TA-MSCs produce large amounts of pro-\nmetastatic and pro-tumor factors such as neuregulin-1 \n[209], VEGF [210], bone morphogenetic proteins [211], \nTGF-β [212], CCL5 [213], CXCL10 [214], CXCL12 [215], \nCD81-positive exosomes [216], and MMPs [217]. Also, \nthey can adjust tumor cell’s response to chemotherapy by \ngenerating factors like polyunsaturated fatty acids [218], \nPDGF [219], hepatocyte growth factor [220], NO [221], \nand exosomes carrying these factors and microRNAs \n[222, 223]. In patients with pancreatic cancer, the pres-\nence of MSCs in the peripheral blood is notable as they \nare thought to migrate to the tumor mass [224]. Evidence \nsuggests that a significant portion of CAFs may originate \nfrom MSCs, which can differentiate and express CAF \nmarkers, such as vimentin and FAP when exposed to \nconditioned media from various human cancer cell cul-\ntures like pancreatic cancer [225]. In a pancreatic cancer \ntumor model, VEGF is secreted by bone marrow mesen-\nchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) that are co-injected with \ntumor cells, which aids in the promotion of tumor angio-\ngenesis [210]. TA-MSCs can produce NO, which induces \nresistance to etoposide in pancreatic tumor cells and \nforms a positive feedback loop with IL-1β, contributing \nto chemotherapy resistance [221].\nCancer‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs)\nCAFs are a hodgepodge and heterogeneous group of \nstromal cells that produce ECM proteins. These cells, \ntypically spindle-shaped, express activated fibroblast \nmarkers like fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and \nα-smooth muscle actin. They are associated with vari-\nous tumor-promoting activities, including tumorigen-\nesis, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and metastasis \n[226, 227]. CAFs in PDAC can originate from diverse \ncells like adipocytes, pericytes, bone marrow-derived \nmacrophages, endothelial/epithelial cells, mesothelial \ncells, MSCs, resident tissue fibroblasts, and pancreatic \nstellate cells (PSCs) [228]. In PDAC stroma, CAFs inter-\nact with cancer cells through both direct cell-to-cell \nand paracrine mechanisms. CAFs are heterogeneous \nand include three subtypes: myofibroblastic, inflamma-\ntory, and antigen-presenting. Myofibroblastic CAFs are \ninduced by cancer cells through TGF-β, and they create \na mechanical barrier that can both promote and inhibit \ntumor growth. Inflammatory CAFs, located away from \nthe tumor cells, are reprogrammed by IL-1 to gener-\nate cytokines and chemokines (like IL-6), which fur-\nther stimulate cancer growth. Lastly, antigen-presenting \nCAFs express MHC class II molecules and modulate the \nimmune cells in the stroma. These diverse interactions \ncontribute to the complex dynamics of the PDAC stroma \n[12]. In the pancreatic environment, CAFs play a signifi-\ncant role in creating an immune-suppressive milieu by \nreleasing substances like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, \nIL-6, CXCL2, CXCL12, and CXCL8 [35, 229–231]. Not \nonly do these fibroblasts attract and control immune-\nsuppressing cells, but they also hinder the anti-cancer \nactivities of ­CD8+ T cells by increasing the expression of \ninhibitory immune checkpoints [230]. Recently, a study \nidentified three distinct metastasis-associated fibroblasts \n(MAFs) populations, with the generation of pro-meta-\nstatic myofibroblastic-MAFs (myMAFs) being critically \ndependent on macrophages. These myMAFs are induced \nthrough a STAT3-dependent mechanism and in turn \npromote an immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype, \ninhibiting cytotoxic T-cell functions. Blocking STAT3 \npharmacologically or depleting it in myMAFs restores \nan anti-tumor immune response and reduces metastasis, \nproviding potential targets to inhibit PDAC liver metas-\ntasis [232].\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)\nApproximately 7% of pancreatic cells are made up of \nPSCs, which are located in both the exocrine and endo-\ncrine regions of the pancreatic tissue. The interaction \nbetween PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells promotes \ntumor progression. Mechanistically, PSCs release several \ngrowth factors/mediators (such as insulin-like growth \nfactor 1 [IGF-1], basal fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], \nplatelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], stromal cell-\nderived factor 1 [SDF-1], and ECM proteins) and MMPs, \nwhich provoke the proliferation, migration, and invasion \nof pancreatic tumor cells. In response, pancreatic cancer"}, {"page_number": 12, "text": "Page 12 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \ncells produce TGF-β1, PDGF, and VEGF, which in turn \nstimulate PSCs to increase the migration and prolif-\neration of CAFs and the production of ECM [233, 234]. \nIndeed, a key characteristic of PDAC is a desmoplastic \nreaction, seen in both primary and metastatic tumors. \nThis reaction is caused by the activation of PSCs, by \ncancer cells, leading to fibrosis around the tumor [235, \n236]. This fibrosis (also known as desmoplasia) forms \na mechanical barrier around the tumor cells, hinder-\ning proper vascularization, limiting the effectiveness of \nchemotherapy, and resulting in poor immune cell infiltra-\ntion [237]. PSCs serve as a significant source of MMP-2 \nand they hasten the advancement of the tumor in a \nmurine xenograft model [238]. Also, TGF-β1 secreted by \nPSCs promotes stemness and tumourigenicity in pancre-\natic cancer cells through L1CAM downregulation [239]. \nOverall, PSCs are linked to ECM production and remod-\neling, intra-tumoral hypoxia, resistance/barrier to chem-\notherapy, proliferation, invasion, migration, reduced \napoptosis, angiogenesis, immune suppression, and pain \nfactors [234].\nEndothelial cells\nPDAC often has abnormal blood and lymphatic vessels, \nleading to a hostile microenvironment characterized by \nhigh acidity, hypoxia, aberrant metabolism, and immune \nevasion. In response, tumors stimulate angiogenesis, pro-\nmoting tumor growth and metastasis [46, 240]. Studies \nreveal that high expression of the endothelial cell marker \nCD31 and genes involved in vascular stability correlate \nwith better prognosis and improved survival in PDAC \n[241, 242]. This suggests that a subset of patients with \nhighly vascular PDAC may benefit from antiangiogenic \ntherapies [242].\nInadequate vasculature in tumors restricts nutrient, \noxygen, and leukocyte delivery, leading to hypoxia in \nPDAC. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is stabi-\nlized in poorly vascularized PDAC tumors [243], acti-\nvating genes crucial for metabolism, angiogenesis, cell \nsurvival, and inflammation [244]. Elevated HIF-1α lev-\nels are linked to poor prognosis in many cancers [244]. \nHowever, in PDAC, HIF-1α deletion accelerates tumor \ngrowth, facilitated by infiltrating B cells, demonstrating \nPDAC’s resilience and complex redundancies that sup-\nport disease progression [245].\nLymphatics, in addition to blood vessels, play a cru-\ncial role in the progression of PDAC. They serve as a \nmajor pathway for leukocytes to transport tumor anti-\ngens to lymph nodes and for cancer cells to spread, often \nresulting in worse survival outcomes [46, 246, 247]. \nChemokines play a role in lymphangiogenesis and cell \nmigration, with lymphatic endothelial cells secreting \nCCL21 to attract DCs and tumor cells expressing CCR7 \npotentially using this mechanism for dissemination [248]. \nLikewise, CXCL12 produced in lymph nodes may attract \ncancer cells or leukocytes expressing CXCR4 [249].\nImmunotherapeutic approaches in pancreatic \ncancer treatment\nPancreatic cancer is classified as non-immunogenic and \nimmunologically cold since it does not effectively react \nto commonly employed ICIs such as anti-PD-1 and anti-\nCTLA-4. This resistance is partly caused by the immu-\nnosuppressive circumstances within the TME. In other \nwords, although ICB has achieved explosive success, \nPDAC has shown limited response to ICB treatment \nalone. Research on using ICB alone or in combination \nwith anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies has yielded \noverall response rates (ORRs) of 0% and 3%, respectively \n[250]. In this part, we will delineate immunotherapeutic \nstrategies such as OVT, adoptive cell transfer therapy, \nICB, cancer vaccine, and immunotherapies targeting \nmyeloid cells (Fig. 3).\nOncolytic virus therapy (OVT)\nOVT represents an innovative form of immunotherapy \nwhere an oncolytic virus, upon infiltrating and lysing a \ncancerous cell, initiates an immune reaction within the \npatient by discharging tumor antigens into the circula-\ntory system [251]. Oncolytic viruses possess desirable \nqualities and specificity that make them an attractive \nstrategy for treatment. Research is currently underway, \nexploring and utilizing diverse oncolytic DNA and RNA \nviruses for the treatment of different cancer forms. Their \nability to invade cancer cells is made possible by the \ngenetic composition of these viruses [252].\nTalimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC or OncoVEXGM-\nCSF), a Herpes simplex virus (HSV), has become the \ninaugural oncolytic virus approved by the US Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mela-\nnoma. The T-VEC virus harbors the genetic integra-\ntion of the GM-CSF gene. T-VEC exhibited remarkable \nlytic properties when tested against various tumor cell \nlines, encompassing pancreatic cancer cells [253, 254]. \nFurthermore, both NV1020 (r7020) and G207, two dis-\ntinct herpes simplex oncolytic viruses, effectively invade \nand annihilate human pancreatic cancer cells in  vitro \nand in  vivo [255]. HF10 is a virus that has originated \nfrom HSV-1 and has experienced an unexpected muta-\ntion. This particular virus has the ability to substantially \ncombat tumors without causing any damage to healthy \ntissue. The treatment of locally advanced pancreatic \ncancer involves the secure administration of HF10 \nthrough direct injection, alongside erlotinib and gemcit-\nabine [256]. The anti-tumor response and apoptosis are \nenhanced in pancreatic cancer when an H-1 oncolytic"}, {"page_number": 13, "text": "Page 13 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

Moreover, it has \nthe ability to generate hyaluronidase, which serves \nto expedite the spread of the virus within the tumor. \nAdditionally, it facilitates the migration of both chemo-\ntherapy medications and immune cells into the tumor. \nVCN-01 exhibited augmented anti-cancer properties \nwhen administered in conjunction with chemotherapy \nto animals with PDAC. Remarkably, the hyaluronidase \nproduced by VCN-01 effectively obliterated the tumor \nstroma, thereby bolstering the transport of various \ntherapeutic drugs such as chemotherapy and therapeu-\ntic antibodies [258]. A clinical experiment exhibited \nthat it is feasible to administer VCN-01 through an \nintravenous route for the treatment of patients suf-\nfering from PDAC and this administration method is \nassociated with adverse events (AEs) that can be pre-\ndicted and controlled. Intravenous VCN-01 has exhib-\nited a positive tolerability profile [259]. These results \nestablish a helpful bedrock for the future use of OVT in \nFig. 3  Immunotherapeutic strategies in pancreatic cancer treatment. The immune response to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) \nis guided by antigen-presenting machinery involving dendritic cells (DCs), inflammatory macrophages, and ­CD4+ helper T cells, leading \nto the activation of ­CD8+ cytotoxic T cells to eliminate the cancer.

Furthermore, sev-\neral clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy \nof various oncolytic virus-oriented therapies in pan-\ncreatic cancer. A phase I/II trial demonstrated that the \ncombination of intratumoral injections of LOAd703, \nan oncolytic adenovirus with transgenes encoding tri-\nmerized, membrane-bound (TMZ)-CD40L and 4-1BB \nligand, \nwith \nstandard \nnab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine \nchemotherapy was both safe and feasible for patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic PDAC. The treatment \nmet the target response rate at the highest dose level, \nwith an ORR of 44% and a disease control rate of 94% \n(NCT02705196) [260]. Moreover, a study found that \nthe combination of pelareorep and pembrolizumab \nshowed modest efficacy in unselected patients, with \na clinical benefit rate of 42% among the 12 patients. \nNotably, the treatment led to significant immunologi-\ncal changes, including a decrease in VDAC1 expression \nin peripheral ­CD8+ T cells and on-treatment periph-\neral ­CD4+ Treg levels in patients who responded to the \ntreatment (NCT03723915) [261]. The efficacy of tali-\nmogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), administered endo-\nscopically, will be assessed in a clinical trial for the \ntreatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic \ncancer that is refractory to at least one chemotherapy \nregimen (NCT03086642).\nA study demonstrates promising findings for a new \ntechnology called ONCOTECH, which combines onco-\nlytic adenoviruses (OAs) with T cells to enhance the \ndelivery of viruses to tumors. The engineered OAs target \nthe immune checkpoint protein PD-L1. In mouse models \nof PDAC, ONCOTECH displayed a notable increase in \nOAs within tumor cells, resulting in a significant decrease \nin PD-L1 expression and better survival rates. In sum-\nmary, ONCOTECH has the potential to be a successful \napproach in combining virotherapy and cell therapy for \ncancer treatment [262].\nAdoptive cell transfer therapy\nAdoptive cellular therapy, which is a type of immuno-\ntherapy, holds promise for cancer patients. By utilizing \nthe patient’s immune cells, such as T cells, this technique \nendeavors to combat the disease. These immune cells \nare frequently obtained, replicated, and altered to aug-\nment their efficiency in directing their focus on cancer. \nThe progress made by the FDA in granting approval to \nCAR T-cell therapy for certain blood cancers has greatly \npropelled this area of medical research. Modified T cells \npossess the ability to discern tumor cells through their \nunique molecular features [263]. In the subsequent dis-\ncussion, we shall elucidate and analyze these various \nimmunotherapeutic approaches.\nTumor‑infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy\nTILs, which are mononuclear cells naturally infiltrat-\ning the TME, can also be known as immune cells pre-\nsent at the tumor site. TIL therapy remains a hopeful \ntreatment approach whereby the patient’s TILs are uti-\nlized following the surgical extraction of the cancerous \ngrowth, followed by the cultivation of these cells out-\nside the body and subsequent reinfusion back into the \npatient [264–266]. Successful techniques for increas-\ning the production and reactivity of TILs encompass \ninhibiting the PD-1 receptor, stimulating the CD137 \nreceptor (4-1BB), and augmenting ­CD8+ T cell levels \n[267]. According to a study, it was found that func-\ntional expanded TILs from tumors in the pancreas pos-\nsess the capability to identify antigens associated with \npancreatic cancer [267]. Based on a meta-analysis, \nthe long-term oncological prognosis of patients with \nPDAC is significantly associated with specific catego-\nries of TILs, specifically ­CD8+ T cells [57]. At the pre-\nsent moment, two ongoing clinical trials are currently \nin the process of recruiting participants. These trials \nwill aim to implement TIL therapy on individuals who \nare affected by metastatic PDAC (NCT03935893 and \nNCT01174121). The former trial will assess the efficacy \nof the adoptive transfer of autologous TILs in combina-\ntion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, while the \nlatter trial will investigate the efficacy of young TILs in \ncombination with aldesleukin (a recombinant analog of \nIL-2), pembrolizumab, cyclophosphamide, and fludara-\nbine. To further explain, the young-TIL approach \ninvolves minimal in  vitro culturing of TILs and does \nnot select for tumor recognition before they are rapidly \nexpanded and infused into the patients. This method \nhas achieved objective response rates similar to those \nof used TILs screened for tumor recognition, without \nintroducing any additional toxicities [268].\nGenetically modified T cells therapy\nTCR‑engineered T‑cell therapy  The production of TCR-\nengineered T cells involves modifying T cells outside the \nbody to express TCRs that recognize tumor antigens. \nTCRs have the capacity to detect peptides displayed by \nboth MHC class I and II [269]. Investigating the safety \nand effectiveness of autologous MSLN-specific TCR T \ncells in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer is the \nobjective of a phase I clinical trial (NCT04809766). In this \ntrial, autologous MSLN-specific TCR-T Cells were used \nin combination with bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, \nand fludarabine. Patients received three infusions of TCR-\nTMSLN cells every 21 days following leukapheresis. The \nmain focus was on safety and dose-limiting toxicities, but \nthe study also looked at ORR, PFS, and OS. The goal is to"}, {"page_number": 15, "text": "Page 15 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n\t\nachieve a significant ORR of 20% among the 15 partici-\npants [270].\nThe patient with metastatic PDAC received autologous \nTCR-engineered T cells as treatment. These modified \nT cells express two allogeneic human leukocyte antigen \n(HLA)-C*08:02-restricted KRAS G12D in a clonal man-\nner. Remarkably, the patient’s visceral metastasis showed \nregression, with an overall partial response of 72%. Fur-\nthermore, the therapeutic effect persisted for a duration \nof 6 months. Moreover, after six months of the T-cell \ntransfer, the modified T cells accounted for more than \n2% of all circulating T cells in the peripheral circulation \n[271].\nCAR​ T‑cell therapy  CAR T cells can be compared to the \nadministration of a living drug to patients. At, the CAR \nT-cell therapies that are accessible are tailored according \nto each patient’s needs. These therapies are created by \ngathering T cells from the patient and modifying them in \nthe lab to generate CARs on the cell surface. The specific \nCARs possess the ability to detect and attach themselves \nto particular proteins, known as tumor antigens, located \non the outer surface of cancer cells. Despite its impressive \nclinical outcomes in the treatment of specific subgroups \nof B-cell leukemia or lymphoma, CAR T-cell therapy \nencounters numerous impediments that impede its wide-\nspread application in the treatment of solid tumors and \nhematological malignancies. Impediments such as life-\nthreatening toxicities, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), \ninadequate anti-tumor efficacy, antigen escape, and lim-\nited trafficking all pose obstacles to the successful imple-\nmentation of CAR T-cell treatment [272, 273]. Tables 2 \nand 3 provide a comprehensive overview of data regard-\ning CAR T-cell therapy in both preclinical and clinical \ntrial settings.\nA crucial obstacle to the effective use of cellular immu-\nnotherapy for treating PDAC, specifically CAR T-cell \ntherapy, is the lack of suitable tumor-specific antigens. In \ntheir research, Schäfer et al. pinpointed CD318, TSPAN8, \nand CD66c as potential target molecules for CAR T-cell-\nbased immunotherapy in PDAC, among a pool of 371 \nantigens [274]. Highlighted in the subsequent text are the \nappropriate therapeutic targets for the CAR T-cell ther-\napy of pancreatic cancer (Fig. 4).\nB7H3 (CD276) B7H3, a molecule found on the surface \nof cells, acts as an immune checkpoint and hinders the \nactivation of T-cells and the ability of NK cells to kill. \nThe promise of targeting B7H3 for CAR T-cell therapy \narises from its high expression in numerous cancer types \nwhile being minimally expressed in healthy tissues [275]. \nSurvival was achieved in mice following treatment with \nB7H3 CAR T cells, and there were no observed AEs \n[276]. The outcome of studies conducted in vitro revealed \nthat these cells exhibited a potent ability to suppress the \ngrowth of cancer cells in the pancreas [276, 277].\nFibroblast activation protein (FAP) FAP is a type-II \ntransmembrane serine protease expressed almost exclu-\nsively on CAFs. In mouse models of solid tumors, the \ngrowth of tumors can be effectively suppressed by FAP-\nexpressing stromal cells being targeted by CAR T cells \ndesigned specifically for FAP [278, 279]. When FAP-spe-\ncific CAR T cells are administered along with anti-PD-1 \ntreatment, the combination leads to a synergistic reduc-\ntion in pancreatic tumor growth and significantly elon-\ngated survival in mouse models compared to alternative \ntreatment combinations [54].\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) \nHER2, a glycoprotein located on the cell membrane, \nperforms a function in promoting cell division and dis-\ntinction during various stages, including embryonic \nand adult periods. HER2 contributes to tumor progres-\nsion, growth, and spread by obstructing cell death, trig-\ngering the formation of new blood vessels, and boosting \ncell movement [275]. The expression of the HER2 in \npancreatic cancer is controversial [280]. However, it has \nbeen detected in 20–60% of PDACs according to cer-\ntain research studies [281, 282]. Also, HER2 might be a \npotential target in immunotherapy for a small subset of \npatients with pancreatic cancer, since a report explains \nnearly 50% of PDAC cases have a total HER2 expression \nof 2 + or above [283, 284].\nThe combination treatment of oncolytic adeno-\nimmunotherapy and HER2-specific CAR-T cells shows \npromising results in eradicating metastatic PDAC. \nTable 2  Evidence from clinical studies supporting the use of CAR T-cell therapy for pancreatic cancer treatment\nEGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor, HER2: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, MSLN: Mesothelin, N/A: Not applicable, ScFv: Single-chain variable \nfragment, PR: Partial response, SD: Stable disease, PD: Progressive disease\nTarget\nCAR’s molecular structure\nCombination therapy\nClinical outcomes \n(= number of patients)\nReferences\nCD133\nAnti-CD133 ScFv + Human CD137 + CD3ζ\nNab-paclitaxel + Cyclophosphamide\nPR = 2, SD = 3, PD = 2\n[307]/NCT02541370\nEGFR\nAnti-EGFR ScFv + CD8α + CD137 + CD3ζ\nNab-paclitaxel + Cyclophosphamide\nPR = 4, SD = 8, PD = 2\n[290]/NCT01869166\nHER2\nAnti-HER2 ScFv + CD8α + CD137 + CD3ζ\nNab-paclitaxel + Cyclophosphamide\nPR = 0, SD = 0, PD = 2\n[286]/NCT01935843\nMSLN\nAnti-MSLN ScFv + 4- 1BB + CD3ζ\nN/A\nSD = 2, PD = 1\n[301]/NCT01897415"}, {"page_number": 16, "text": "Page 16 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

The clinical effect of \nanti-HER2 CAR T cells was assessed in a study involv-\ning 11 patients, two of whom had metastatic pancreatic \ncancer. The optimal overall outcome for both patients \nwas disease stability, with a PFS of 5.3 and 8.3 months, \nrespectively [286]. The potential clinical outcomes of \nthe treatment should be proven in clinical trials with a \nlarger sample size including patients with PDAC.\nAll in all, in different studies, the expression of HER2 \nin pancreatic cancer is controversial and varies from \nhigh-level expression [287] to low-level expression \n[288], making it a potential target for personalized \nimmunotherapy of PDAC. Thus, it is reasonable that \nHER2 should not be ignored in such a heterogeneous \ndisease with limited treatment options.\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) The EGFR \nprotein, which spans across the membrane, has the capa-\nbility of binding to various proteins from the EGF family \nthat are located outside the cell. Around 90% of patients \ndiagnosed with PDAC exhibit an identifiable amount of \nEGFR [289]. For individuals diagnosed with metastatic \npancreatic cancer, the safety and effectiveness of the \ntreatment were demonstrated by a median overall sur-\nvival (mOS) of 4.9 months among the entire group of 14 \npatients who received anti-EGFR CAR T cells [290].\nSialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin (Siglec) \nCell-surface proteins known as Siglecs exhibit the abil-\nity to attach themselves to sialic acid. These proteins are \npredominantly present in immune cells, belonging to a \nFig. 4  An overview of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy concept. CAR T cell therapy is a treatment approach, whereby T cells \nfrom an individual are modified in a laboratory setting to possess the ability to identify specific antigens found on cancer cells, leading to their \nelimination. (1) This process involves removing autologous T cells from the patient’s blood. (2) Subsequently, the T cells are manipulated \nby introducing a gene encoding a specialized receptor, known as a CAR, into their genetic makeup through viral vectors. (3) This genetic \nalteration results in the expression of the CAR protein on the surface of the patient’s T cells, thereby creating CAR T cells. These CAR T cells are then \nmultiplied and expanded in laboratory conditions, producing millions of them. (4) Eventually, these CAR T cells are administered to the patient \nthrough intravenous infusion. (5) The CAR T cells attach themselves to the cancer cells by binding to the antigens present on their surface \nand proceed to eradicate the cancer cells.

A new advancement comprises the devel-\nopment of CAR T cells based on Siglec-7/9, which specif-\nically target tumor cells that express sialic acid, causing a \ndelay in the growth of tumors within a melanoma model \n[291]. According to a study, Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 ligands \nare specifically expressed by PDAC cells, indicating \nthe potential effectiveness of CAR T cells in combating \nPDAC [292]. Furthermore, enhancing the effectiveness of \nsolid tumor cellular immunotherapy is greatly facilitated \nby the cancer cell desialylation approach that reverses the \nstate of immune evasion. By eliminating the Siglec-5 and \nSiglec-10 genes, it became possible to make a CAR mac-\nrophage that exhibits enhanced anti-cancer activity as a \nresult of blocking the glycoimmune checkpoint [293].\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) In order to evaluate \nthe efficacy of CEA-specific CAR T cells in combina-\ntion with recombinant human IL-12 for the treatment \nof various solid tumors, an experiment was conducted. \nThe findings illustrated that the incorporation of rhIL-12 \nalongside anti-CEA CAR T cells notably augmented their \ncapacity to suppress the proliferation of pancreatic tumor \ncells when compared to solely utilizing CEA CAR T-cell \ntreatment [294]. Regarding the central role of IL-12 in \nCAR T cells, a study has proven that membrane-bound \nIL-12 in CAR T cells targeting TAG72 promotes anti-\ntumor responses against human ovarian cancer xeno-\ngraft models [295]. However, there is a need to apply this \napproach in PDAC that has not been met.\nAdditionally, CEACAM7 (CGM2), which is a part \nof the CEA protein family, may serve as a potential tar-\nget for PDAC and is specifically present exclusively in \nthe colon and the pancreas. The remission of xenograft \ntumors occurs as a result of the targeted destruction of \npancreatic cancer cells expressing the specific antigen by \nCAR T cells designed to recognize CEACAM7 [296].\nMesothelin (MSLN) CAR T cells have the ability to be \naltered in a way that enables them to identify a cell surface \nantigen called MSLN. This antigen is associated with the \ninvasion of tumors and is present in mesothelial tissues, \nalbeit in small amounts. However, it is highly expressed \nin PDAC [275]. A potent anti-MSLN hYP218 CAR T \ncells possess improved abilities to infiltrate and remain \nin tumors, enhancing their effectiveness in combating \npancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo [297]. CAR T cell \ntherapy, which targets both MSLN and CD19 simulta-\nneously, proved to be a safe and well-tolerated approach \nin treating individuals suffering from metastatic PDAC \n[298]. In orthotopic animal models of human pancreatic \ncancer, it was demonstrated that MSLN-specific CAR T \ncells are efficient [299]. Mice with extremely aggressive \nPDAC experience tumor shrinkage when subjected to a \nmixture of MSLN-redirected CAR T cells and TNF-α/IL-\n2-armed oncolytic adenoviruses [300]. In a phase 1 trial, \nT cells engineered to express a CAR specific for MSLN \nwere tested in six patients with chemotherapy-refractory \nmetastatic PDAC. The treatment was well tolerated, with \nno serious toxicities. Disease stabilized in two patients, \nand one patient showed a significant reduction in tumor \nmetabolic activity, providing evidence of the potential \nanti-tumor activity of these engineered T cells [301].\nDisialoganglioside (GD2) GD2, present on the exter-\nnal cellular membrane, is integral to the immunological \ncharacteristics of mammalian cells; however, it rarely \nelicits an immune reaction. Due to the prevalence of GD2 \nin embryonal malignancies such as brain tumors and its \ninfrequent manifestation in healthy cells, it is viable to \ntarget GD2 molecules using CAR T cells specific to this \nmolecule [275].\nNatural killer group 2D (NKG2D) The NKG2D receptor \nshows potential as a target for immunotherapy of malig-\nnant neoplasms. CAR T cells specific to NKG2D have \nbeen employed in the treatment of patients with hema-\ntologic and solid tumors. An evaluation was conducted \nby researchers to determine the practicality and safety \nof NKG2D-specific CAR T cells, resulting in the discov-\nery that their capacity to multiply and endure within the \nbody was restricted. Gao and colleagues have success-\nfully suppressed the 4.1R gene in NKG2D-specific CAR \nT cells, thereby augmenting the efficacy of CAR T cells in \ncombatting pancreatic carcinoma [302].\nEpithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) EpCAM is a \ntransmembrane glycoprotein of type I that is excessively \nexpressed in various carcinomas, for instance, colon, \nstomach, PDAC, and endometrial malignancies. Its con-\nnection to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has \nbeen observed, which is believed to trigger inadequate \ninfiltration of T-cells in different human malignancies \n[275]. A number of clinical trials have been registered \nto utilize EpCAM-specific CAR T cells in individuals \nsuffering from pancreatic cancer (NCT04151186 and \nNCT03013712). In these trials, outcomes like toxic-\nity profile, survival time and persistence of CAR T cells \nin vivo, and anti-tumor efficacy will be measured.\nMucin-1 (MUC-1; CD227) At the apical surface of \nepithelial cells, the transmembrane mucin glycoprotein \nMUC-1 shows a high level of expression. In more than \n80% of human PDAC, MUC-1 is excessively expressed. \nThis excessive expression of MUC-1 is associated with \na grim prognosis and increased metastasis. Moreover, \nthrough the upregulation of multidrug resistance genes, \nMUC-1 boosts chemo-resistance in pancreatic cancer \ncells [303]. In xenograft models of pancreatic cancer, \nthere was successful inhibition of tumor growth by anti-\nMUC-1 CAR T cells, which exhibited effective targeting"}, {"page_number": 19, "text": "Page 19 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n\t\ncapabilities and induced cytotoxicity [304]. To investi-\ngate the effectiveness of MUC-1-specific CAR T cells on \nindividuals suffering from pancreatic cancer, two clini-\ncal trials have been officially registered under the codes \nNCT05239143 and NCT04025216. The former clinical \ntrials demonstrated three patients with different types of \ncancer have been treated with anti-MUC-1 CAR T cells, \nshowing good tolerance and no observed toxicities [305]. \nLatter clinical trial showed safety and preliminary efficacy \nin treating various solid tumors, with no dose-limiting \ntoxicities observed in the six treated patients and prelimi-\nnary results indicating stable disease in all patients [306].\nCD133 Both hematopoietic cells and epithelial cells \nexhibit the pentaspan transmembrane glycoprotein \nCD133. CD133 has been identified not only in pancreatic \ncancer CSCs but also in different tumors like hepatocel-\nlular and gastric carcinomas, emphasizing its widespread \npresence in malignancies. In 50% of cases involving pan-\ncreatic cancer, the expression of CD133 was observed \nto be significantly high [289]. CD133-specific CAR T \ncells were administered to 7 individuals who suffer from \nPDAC during a phase 1 clinical trial. Before the infusion \nof CAR T cells, the patients were treated with cyclophos-\nphamide and nab-paclitaxel. The outcomes of the trial \nexhibited 3 instances of disease stabilization, 2 instances \nof partial remission, and 2 instances of disease progres-\nsion [307].\nProstate stem cell antigen (PSCA) Initially, PSCA was \nidentified as a surface glycoprotein that consists of 123 \namino acids and is linked to glycophosphatidylinosi-\ntol. Its function remained unknown, although it showed \nsignificant presence in prostate cancers while exhibit-\ning minimal levels in the prostate epithelium, urinary \nbladder, kidney, esophagus, stomach, and placenta. Fur-\nther investigations confirmed its amplified expression \nin various human cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, \nwhile being absent in a healthy pancreas. By employing \na humanized mouse model for pancreatic cancer, it was \nobserved that CAR T cells specifically targeting PSCA \nwere able to prompt the eradication of tumors [308].\nCD47 CD47, an immunoglobulin superfamily mem-\nber, frequently exhibits heightened expression in various \nhematological and solid cancer tumors. Its crucial func-\ntion involves the inhibition of phagocytosis, leading to \nenhanced tumor survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. \nCD47 is recognized as a \"don’t eat me\" since it bonds with \nsignaling regulatory protein alpha (SIRP-α) and obstructs \nthe phagocytosis of cancer cells [309]. The blocking of \npancreatic xenograft tumor growth is efficiently accom-\nplished and cancer cells are effectively killed by CD47-\nspecific CAR-T cells [310]. A significant challenge in \nusing CD47-CAR-T cells could be the potential detri-\nmental effects on red blood cells and platelets due to \nthe expression of CD47 on these cells. However, in this \nstudy, CD47-CAR-T cells were administered intratumor-\nally, which may prevent the induction of toxic effects on \nother cells. Therefore, the clearing of blood cells during \nsystemic injection of this treatment should be considered \nas a potential AE.\nClaudin18.2 (CLDN18.2) The protein known as \nCLDN18.2 is an isoform-specific to the stomach of the \nCLDN18 tight junction protein. This protein is found in \nhigh levels in various types of cancer, particularly those \naffecting the digestive system like pancreatic cancer. \nTherefore, it could be a promising candidate for can-\ncer treatment strategies [311–313]. Studies indicated a \npositive response rate for CT041, which are autologous \nT cells that have been genetically modified to express \na CAR targeting CLDN18.2, in cases of digestive sys-\ntem malignancies [311, 314–316]. Two patients with \nmetastatic pancreatic cancer were treated with anti-\nCLDN18.2 CAR T cell therapy (CT041) after standard \ntreatments failed. Both patients experienced CRS, which \nwas managed with tocilizumab. The first patient showed \na partial response with a significant reduction in lung \nmetastasis, while the second patient achieved a complete \nresponse. Both cases experienced an increase in ­CD8+ \nT cells and Treg cells, a decrease in ­CD4+ T cells and B \ncells, an increase in IL-8, and a decrease in TGF-β1. The \ntumors were well-controlled at the last follow-up [312].\nCAR​‑NK cell therapy  CAR NK cell therapy is a prom-\nising strategy in cancer treatment that seeks to enhance \nthe cancer-fighting power of NK cells. CAR-NK cells \nare engineered to express CARs that recognize specific \nantigens in cancer cells, which allows them to target \nand kill cancer cells more effectively [106, 317]. Table 4 \nprovides a comprehensive comparison between CAR T \ncells and CAR NK cells. Compared to CAR T cells, CAR \nNK cells possess multiple benefits. Their limited lifes-\npan implies a decreased likelihood of unintended harm \nto healthy cells (referred to as on-target/off-tumor tox-\nicity). The unique set of cytokines they release signifies \na reduced potential for CRS and neurotoxicity. Further-\nmore, their lower propensity for alloreactivity facilitates \nthe production of off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR NK cells \nderived from NK cell lines [318]. However, they may \nhave several negative points, which restrict their broad \napplication in clinical contexts. First of all, difficulties in \nproper antigen selection, antigen heterogeneity, donor \nselection, challenges in designing an effective CAR, and \ndifficulties in producing and storing CAR NK cells are \nfundamental hurdles in this type of treatment modality \n[106, 319]. Secondly, issues such as NK cell infiltration \ninto tumor sites and the short half-life of NK cells must \nbe considered [319]. This short lifespan can necessitate"}, {"page_number": 20, "text": "Page 20 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

Thus, \nthe universally expressed HLA molecules on nucleated \ncells can inhibit CAR NK cell function [318]. Thus, the \ntranslation of CAR NK cell therapy from bench to bed-\nside requires addressing the aforementioned challenges \nproperly.\nWhen ROBO1 is targeted, CAR-NK immunotherapy \naccompanied by radiation therapy proves to be more \neffective in treating human PDAC in an orthotopic \nmouse model [322]. A study demonstrates the effective-\nness of a novel human NK cell-based immunotherapy \ntargeting PSCA. It found that these cells effectively sup-\npressed ­PSCA+ pancreatic cancer in  vitro and in  vivo. \nThe therapy showed promising results without caus-\ning systemic toxicity [323]. Furthermore, the inhibi-\ntion of tumor growth and enhancement of survival were \nobserved in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer when \nutilizing a fusion of CAR-NK cells that targeted MSLN, \nalong with cGAMP, an agonist for STING [324]. There \nare two clinical trials that have been registered for the \nimplementation of ROBO1 and MUC-1-specific CAR \nNK cells in the existing clinical scenario of immunothera-\npeutic methods, specifically for patients diagnosed with \npancreatic cancer (NCT03941457 and NCT02839954). \nOutcome measurements include an examination of the \nsafety profile and ORR.\nIn the realm of immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer, \nPSCA has recently gained acclaim as a promising con-\ntender. Research findings highlight that CAR-NK cells \ndesigned to target PSCA demonstrate notable efficacy in \ncombating advanced PDAC in humans, all while ensur-\ning the absence of any harmful effects at a systemic level \n[323]. These positive outcomes provide a rigorous ration-\nale for the future progression of clinical trials.\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a \nconvenient supply of lymphocytes for immunotherapy. \nThese NK cells, derived from iPSCs, express essential \nNK-defining markers such as CD56 and CD16. They \ndemonstrate cytotoxicity through cytokine secretion \nand ADCC, showing potential for cancer treatment \n[325, 326]. The first-in-class, off-the-shelf iPSC-derived \nNK cell therapy called FT500 is currently being evalu-\nated in a phase I clinical trial. This trial aims to treat \nadvanced solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer. \nFT500 is administered both as a monotherapy and \nin combination with checkpoint inhibitor therapy \n(nivolumab, pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab), IL-2, \ncyclophosphamide, and fludarabine (NCT03841110).\nCytokine‑induced killer (CIK) cell therapy  CIK cells \nform a diverse group of ­CD8+ T cells that were produced \nfrom lymphocytes extracted from human peripheral \nblood and simply expanded ex vivo through incubation \nwith an anti-CD3 antibody, IFN-γ, and IL-2. Through \nFasL and perforin, they have the ability to eliminate can-\ncer cells. Depending on the existence of the cell surface \nmolecule CD56, CIK cells are additionally categorized \ninto two primary subsets: T cells that are positive for \nCD3 and CD56, and T cells that are positive for CD3 but \nnegative for CD56 [327]. Adopting CIK cells and trans-\nferring them has proven to be highly effective and safe \nin cancer treatment, as demonstrated by the increased \nsurvival of individuals affected by different types of \ntumors. When utilized alongside chemotherapy, CIK \ncell therapy exhibits enhanced efficiency in thwarting \ncancer relapse and enhancing patients’ prognosis [24].\nResearchers have investigated the application of CIK \ncells as a potential second-line treatment for advanced \npancreatic cancer, which has yielded encouraging out-\ncomes in both standalone usage and when combined \nwith other therapeutic methods. In a phase II clinical \ninvestigation, the inclusion of CIK cells alongside gem-\ncitabine-refractory advanced pancreatic cancer dem-\nonstrated a mOS of 6.2 months among patients [328]. \nIn advanced pancreatic cancer, gemcitabine-resistant \npatients who underwent CIK cell therapy in combina-\ntion with S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, dem-\nonstrated a mOS of 6.6 months, surpassing the mOS \nof patients solely treated with S-1 alone (6.1 months) \n[329]. Following CIK cell therapy, individuals diag-\nnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer exhibit notable \nenhancements in the OS [330].\nImmune checkpoint‑oriented immunotherapy\nImmunotherapy has become a leading pillar of can-\ncer treatment, thanks to the triumph of an effective \nICB method, mainly exemplified by the approval of \nipilimumab in 2011. By inhibiting specific inhibi-\ntory immune checkpoints like CTLA-4, PD-1, and \nPD-L1, ICB actively halts or reverses the development \nof acquired peripheral tolerance to cancer antigens, \nconsequently restoring T-cell activation [331].

Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \nInhibitory immune checkpoints\nPD‑1/PD‑L1 axis  The PD-1/PD-L1 axis has been stud-\nied in relation to immune checkpoint molecules in pan-\ncreatic cancer following the successful use of anti-PD-1/\nPD-L1 treatment in melanoma. PD-1 is a member of \nthe B7-CD28 protein family and its expression is asso-\nciated with T-cell exhaustion. PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and \nPD-L2) are expressed by tumor cells, MDSCs, TAMs, \nand tumor-infiltrating DCs. Engagement between PD-1 \nand PD-L1 leads to T-cell exhaustion by blocking T-cell \nactivation [332, 333]. Certain malignancies have demon-\nstrated promising results when treated solely with PD-1/\nPD-L1 inhibitors [334, 335]. PD-L1 inhibitors elicit differ-\nent reactions in individuals, as evidenced by some PD-L1 \npositive patients exhibiting unfavorable responses while \nsome PD-L1 negative patients responding favorably. This \nimplies the potential involvement of other PD-1 ligands, \nlike PD-L2, in impacting the efficacy of PD-1 axis immu-\nnotherapy in specific cancers. A body of research accen-\ntuates the notion that PD-L2 influences the anti-PD-1 \naxis immunotherapy, particularly in PDAC [336, 337]. \nChemotherapy-induced senescent cancer cells modify \nthe TME, promoting immunosuppression and pancreatic \ntumor growth. PD-L2 is highly upregulated in senescent \ncancer cells, helping them evade the immune system and \npersist within tumors. Blocking PD-L2 in combination \nwith chemotherapy leads to tumor regression and remis-\nsion in mice [338], offering a promising therapeutic strat-\negy targeting senescence-induced vulnerabilities.\nCombination immunotherapy targeting PD-L1 and \nCCL5 has shown benefits in PDAC by decreasing Treg \nand TAM infiltration, inducing ­CD8+ T-cell activa-\ntion, promoting tumor regression, and improving OS \n[339]. Tumor regression, improved OS, and the genera-\ntion of anti-tumor memory cells were achieved by the \njoint action of anti-tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 \n(TNFR2) and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, by reduc-\ning the infiltration of Tregs and TAMs while activating \n­CD8+ T-cells in PDAC microenvironment [340]. ADH-\n503, an agonist of CD11b, exerts an agonistic influence \non innate immune responses, leading to a reprogram-\nming effect. This reprogramming enhances the \nresponse of innate immune responses towards immu-\nnotherapies, specifically anti-PD-L1 antagonists and \nanti-4-1BB agonists, thereby facilitating a more effec-\ntive therapeutic outcome in the treatment of pancre-\natic cancer [341]. A bispecific immunocytokine (PD-1/\nIL-2 complex) targeting of PD-1 and IL-2Rβγ enhances \ntumor-antigen-specific T-cell activation while reducing \nTreg-mediated suppression. The use of this immuno-\ncytokine, combined with radiotherapy, attenuates the \nprogression of pancreatic cancer and impedes its meta-\nstatic potential [342].\nCTLA‑4 (CD152)  CTLA-4 is predominantly found in \nTregs and its expression increases when T-cells are acti-\nvated. CTLA-4 works intrinsically by suppressing the \nco-stimulatory signal within the cell, inhibiting T-cell \nactivation. It also acts externally by removing CD80 and \nCD86 from APCs, which reduces the response of effec-\ntor T cells [332]. Controlling the pathway of CTLA-4/\nCD80 regulates the entry of T cells into the microenviron-\nment of pancreatic cancer. By interrupting the interaction \nbetween CTLA-4 and CD80, one can induce the infiltra-\ntion of ­CD4+ and ­CD8+ T-cells into the microenviron-\nment of PDAC [343]. Pancreatic tumors can be regressed \nby inhibiting both IL-6 and CTLA-4, and this regression \noccurs through a T cell and CXCR3-dependent mecha-\nnism [344].\nLAG‑3  Cancer cells utilize the LAG-3 signaling path-\nway to escape the immune system’s detection. Through \ninteraction with Galectin-3, activated T cells experience \ndecreased functionality. Moreover, the activity of plasma-\ncytoid DCs, responsible for initiating the growth of naïve \nT cells, is hindered by LAG-3. Additionally, LAG-3 has \nthe capacity to regulate T-cell proliferation, reduce mem-\nory and effector T-cell immune responses, and heighten \nimmunosuppression through the suppression mediated \nby Tregs [332]. Pancreatic cancer patients with TILs that \nexpress LAG-3 exhibit lower rates of DFS [345]. Anti-\ntumor immunity and enduring response in pancreatic \ncancer can be achieved by directing attention towards T \ncell checkpoints 4-1BB and LAG-3, alongside myeloid cell \nCXCR1/CXCR2 [346].\nTIGIT  The expression of TIGIT occurs on the surface \nof immune cells and results in the inhibition of T-cell \nstimulation. By attaching to CD155 and CD112, TIGIT \ngenerates signals that suppress the activation of T-cells. \nAdditionally, TIGIT can competitively bind to CD226 \nor CD96 along with CD155 and CD112 in order to sup-\npress the active signal received by T-cells [347]. Increased \nPD-1 and TIGIT expression were evident in intratumoral \nT cells [348]. Thus, to optimize the responses of ­CD8+ T \ncells against tumors, it is necessary to co-block the TIGIT \nand PD-1 inhibitory pathways due to their mechanistic \nconvergence [349]. The co-blockade of PD-1 and TIGIT \non tissue-resident memory T cells in PDAC revitalizes \nthem [350]. In pancreatic cancer, the CD155/TIGIT axis \nplays a significant role in boosting and sustaining immune \nevasion [351]. Combining TIGIT and PD-1 blockade \nenhances the efficacy of vaccinations in a model of pan-\ncreatic cancer [352]. The reinvigoration of T lymphocytes \nspecific to pancreatic tumor cells occurred as a result \nof the co-blockade of TIGIT/PD-1 and the stimulation \nof CD40 agonist [351]. A research study uncovered that"}, {"page_number": 29, "text": "Page 29 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n\t\ninteractions in samples of human PDAC decrease follow-\ning chemotherapy, specifically between TIGIT on ­CD8+ T \ncells and its receptor on cancer cells. TIGIT was identi-\nfied as the primary inhibitory checkpoint molecule of \n­CD8+ T cells, revealing that chemotherapy greatly affects \nthe PDAC TME and potentially enhances resistance to \nimmunotherapy [353].\nV‑domain Ig‑containing suppressor of  T‑cell activation \n(VISTA)  VISTA is an original member of the B7 fam-\nily checkpoint molecules. It exerts a distinctive influence \non cancer immune evasion through its distinct expres-\nsion patterns and functions. In contrast to checkpoints \nthat mainly control T-cell effector function and exhaus-\ntion, VISTA has various roles. It aids in the functioning of \nMDSCs, governs the activation of NK cells, promotes the \nsurvival of Tregs, restricts antigen presentation on APCs, \nand also maintains T cells in a state of rest [354–356]. The \nexpression of VISTA is associated with a more favorable \nprognosis in cases of pancreatic cancer [357]. Pancreatic \ncancer exhibits an increased expression of the immuno-\nlogical checkpoint VISTA. It has been shown that the acti-\nvation of VISTA hinders the production of cytokines by T \ncells that are obtained from metastatic pancreatic cancers \n[358]. Given this, monoclonal antibodies against VISTA \ncould potentially function as a beneficial immunothera-\npeutic approach for individuals diagnosed with pancreatic \ncancer [357, 358].\nCD39/CD73 axis  Extracellular adenosine is a metabolite \nthat suppresses the immune system and affects adversely \nboth innate and adaptive immune responses. It is accu-\nmulated through the actions of two ectonucleotidases, \nCD39 and CD73. Adenosine exerts its immunosuppres-\nsive effects by binding to A2A receptors on lymphoid and \nmyeloid cells, as well as A2B receptors on myeloid cells. \nThese A2B receptors are frequently overexpressed in can-\ncer cells and have been found to promote tumor growth, \nspread, and resistance to chemotherapy [359, 360]. In \nPDAC, the levels of CD73 are notably elevated com-\npared to other types of cancer. This correlation is associ-\nated with negative clinical results [361]. The findings of \na study highlight the significant role of CD39 and CD73 \nin promoting PDAC progression. The expression of these \nectonucleotidases was associated with worse survival \noutcomes in human PDAC samples and disrupted the \npositive impact of tumor-infiltrating ­CD8+ T cells. Fur-\nthermore, targeting both CD39 and CD73 demonstrated \nsuperior anti-tumor activity compared to individual inhi-\nbition, emphasizing the potential of these molecules as \ntherapeutic targets in PDAC [362]. Several anti-CD73/\nCD39 antibody-oriented clinical trials are underway, \nwhich will assess the effectiveness of agents like ole-\nclumab or MEDI9447 (anti-CD73; NCT02503774), TTX-\n030 (anti-CD39; NCT03884556), and CPI-006 or mup-\nadolimab (anti-CD73; NCT03454451) [363] alone or in \ncombination with other ICIs. Regarding NCT02503774, \nthe study involved the treatment of 192 patients with ole-\nclumab and durvalumab (anti-PD-L1), with no instances \nof dose-limiting toxicities during the escalation phase. \nThe most frequently observed side effects were fatigue, \ndiarrhea, and rash. While the escalation phase showed no \nobjective response, the expansion cohorts demonstrated \nsome positive response rates [364].\nBispecific antibodies (BsAbs)\nBsAbs have been engineered to effectively engage two \nspecific antigens at the same time. These specialized \nantibodies effectively modulate the immune response by \nredirecting and stimulating immune cells, blocking the \nco-inhibitory receptors on these cells, activating mole-\ncules that enhance the immune response, interfering with \nspecific signaling pathways, and employing a strategy of \nsimultaneously targeting multiple cancer antigens [365]. \nBsAbs have been developed for pancreatic cancer treat-\nment, with examples such as anti-EGFR × HER2 [366], \nanti-CD3 × CEA [367], MCLA-128 (anti-HER2 × HER3 \nBsAb; \nzenocutuzumab) \n[368], \nanti-CD3 × EGFR \nBsAb [369], anti-CD3 (Vγ9TCR) × HER2/Neu [370], \nXmAb22841 (anti-LAG-3 × CTLA-4; NCT03849469), \nXmAb23104 (anti-PD-1 × inducible co-stimulatory mol-\necule [ICOS]) [371], ATOR-1015 (anti-CTLA-4 × OX40) \n[372], and KN046 (anti-CTLA-4 × PD-L1) [373]. BsAb \ntargeting CD3 and EGFR-armed activated T cells have \nthe ability to target and kill drug-resistant pancreatic \ncancer cells. Furthermore, the \"priming\" of these resist-\nant cells with BsAb-armed activated T cells enhances \ntheir responsiveness to chemotherapeutic drugs through \nmodulation of ABC transporter expression [369]. These \nfindings provide insight into the use of BsAbs for immu-\nnotherapy against PDAC. A trial tests XmAb23104’s effi-\ncacy and safety in treating advanced solid tumors, both \nalone and with ipilimumab (NCT03752398). The study \nshowed that XmAb23104 was generally well tolerated \nat doses up to 15 mg/kg in subjects with advanced solid \ntumors. Clinical activity was observed, including partial \nresponses in three subjects and stable disease for over 12 \nmonths in two subjects [371].\nCancer vaccines\nThere are several types of cancer vaccines, includ-\ning whole tumor cell vaccines, DC vaccines, peptide \nvaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines.

Up to this point, \nthe FDA has granted approval to a solitary therapeu-\ntic vaccine for cancer treatment, namely sipuleucel-T \n(PROVENGE). This particular vaccine solely enhances \npatient survival in prostate cancer cases by a mere 4 \nmonths [374].\nVaccination is being examined to activate or enhance \npre-existing immune responses using agents like \nGVAX (pancreatic cell lines modified with GM-CSF) \nor CRS207 (live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes \nexpressing MSLN), either alone or in combination with \na mAb targeting the CD40 molecule to activate APCs \n[41]. In this section, we provide an overview of various \ntypes of cancer vaccines and underscore the significant \nstudies conducted with these vaccines (Tables 6, 7).\nWhole tumor cell vaccines\nUtilizing a tumor cell vaccination is a simple and straight-\nforward approach to tumor immunotherapy. The tumor \ncell vaccination contains both ­CD4+ helper T-cell and \nCTL epitopes. Algenpantucel-L (NLG0205) is an example \nof such a vaccine. Results from a phase II study demon-\nstrated that the combination of Algenpantucel-L with the \nadjuvants gemcitabine and 5-fluoruracil yielded an 86% \nsurvival rate at one year, a 51% survival rate at two years, \nand a 42% survival rate at three years [375]. Nevertheless, \na study demonstrated that Algenpantucel immunother-\napy did not yield advantages for patients suffering from \nadvanced PDAC, despite following the standard of care, \nneo-adjuvant chemotherapy, and chemoradiation [376].\nTo elicit T-cell immune responses against various \ntumor antigens, scientists manufactured a pancreatic \nTable 6  Categorization of cancer vaccines in the context of pancreatic cancer therapy\nCEA: Carcinoembryonic antigen, DC: Dendritic cell, ENO1: α-Enolase, FAPα: Fibroblast activation protein alpha, HSP: Heat-shock protein, iPSC: Induced pluripotent \nstem cell, LAK: Lymphokine-activated killer, MSLN: Mesothelin, MUC1: Mucin-1, TAA: Tumor-associated antigen, TSA: Tumor-specific antigen, VEGFR: Vascular \nendothelial growth factor receptor, VNTRn: Variable number tandem repeat, WT1: Wilms’ tumor 1\nType\nMechanism of action\nCancer vaccine\nReferences\nWhole tumor cell vaccine\nIrradiated tumor cells elicit an immune \nresponse targeting TSAs or TAAs, which are \nproteins expressed by tumor cells\nAlgenpantucel-L (NLG0205)\n[375]\nPhotothermal nanoparticle-loaded tumor \ncells\n[607]\nGVAX\n[41, 381, 608]\nDC vaccine\nDCs are pulsed with TAAs or TSAs, presenting \nthem to effector T cells, resulting in specific \nimmune responses against tumor cells \nexpressing corresponding tumor antigens\nMUC1-pulsed DCs\n[383]\nWT1-pulsed DCs\n[388]\nα-Galactosylceramide-pulsed DCs\n[392]\nMAGE-A3-pulsed DCs\n[609]\nMesothelioma lysate-pulsed DCs\n[390]\nDC vaccine plus LAK cells\n[391]\nDCs loaded with mRNA encoding CEA\n[610]\nPeptide vaccine\nEpitope, peptide, or protein expressed \nby pancreatic tumor cells elicits robust \nimmune responses\nRAS oncogene-based vaccine: GI-4000, TG01\n[611–614]\nHSP-peptide complex-based vaccines: \nHSPPC-96\n[615]\nSurvivin-based vaccine: AYACNTSTL\n[616]\nVEGFR-based vaccine: VXM01\n[404, 617, 618]\nGastrin-based vaccine: G17DT\n[619, 620]\nTelomerase-based vaccine: GV1001\n[393, 394]\nDNA vaccine\nTransferring a DNA into an organism’s system \nwith the aim of producing an antigen, which \nin turn triggers a safeguarding immune \nresponse\nENO1 DNA vaccine\n[397, 398]\nMUC1-VNTRn\n[399]\nChimeric DNA encoding FAPα and survivin\n[400]\nmRNA vaccine\nThe mRNA encoding TSAs, TAAs, and tumor \nneo-antigens induce a robust immune \nresponse\nRO7198457 (Autogene Cevumeran)\n[401]/NCT04161755\nViral/bacterial vector-based vaccine This type of vaccine use an immunogenic \nviral or bacterial vectors to deliver the mRNA \nencoding TAAs or TSAs\nHeat-killed whole cell vaccine of Mycobacte-\nrium Obuense: IMM101\n[621, 622]\nLive-attenuated Listeria Monocytogenes \nencoding MSLN: CRS-207\n[41]\nIntracellular delivering Salmonella\n[403]\nStem cell-based vaccine\nInduction of anti-tumor immunity \nby oncofetal antigens\niPSC-based cancer vaccine, comprised \nof autologous iPSCs and CpG\n[406]"}, {"page_number": 31, "text": "Page 31 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

This particular vaccine, \nclassified as allogeneic, consists of human GM-CSF-\nsecreting whole tumor cells [377–380]. A study’s findings \nreveal that neo-adjuvant and adjuvant GVAX, with or \nwithout nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) \nand urelumab (an anti-CD137 agonist), are safe. Fur-\nthermore, treating with GVAX alongside nivolumab and \nurelumab leads to a remarkable increase in tumor-infil-\ntrating activated effector T cells. This combination also \ndemonstrates efficacy by substantially enhancing DFS in \ncomparison to GVAX with or without nivolumab [381].\nDC vaccines\nDCs that were isolated from the patient’s peripheral blood \nwere loaded with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or \ntumor-derived mRNA. After the administration of these \nvaccines, the modified DCs proceed to the lymph nodes, \nwhere they transmit antigens to T lymphocytes and con-\ncurrently induce co-stimulatory signals [382]. In a study, \nDCs were gathered from 7 patients who had stage III/IV \npancreatic cancer through the employment of apheresis. \nAfterwards, these collected DCs underwent the pro-\ncess of being pulsed with MUC-1 peptide. The injection \nof MUC-1-pulsed DCs in these patients exhibited both \nsafety and efficacy, successfully triggering an immune \nresponse towards the MUC-1 [383].\nMany pancreatic cancer cells exhibit overexpression of \nthe Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT1). Several studies assessed the \neffectiveness of using DCs pulsed with WT1 peptides \nand chemotherapy in treating advanced pancreatic can-\ncer [384–388]. A retrospective multicenter analysis was \nconducted on 255 patients with pancreatic cancer. These \npatients were receiving standard chemotherapy and a DC \nvaccine. This study showed that in patients with pancre-\natic cancer who received a DC vaccine, a positive ery-\nthema reaction at the site of DC vaccine injection was \nlinked to better survival [389].\nThe impact of using mesothelioma lysate-loaded DCs \nin combination with FGK45 (a CD40 agonist) was exam-\nined in PDAC mice models. This innovative technique \nprovoked a remarkable alteration in the transcriptome of \nthe tumor, involving the suppressive indicators on ­CD8+ \nT cells, and resulted in a considerable improvement in \nsurvival [390]. The administration of lymphokine-acti-\nvated killer (LAK) cell therapy significantly extended the \nsurvival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who \nunderwent DC vaccine-based immunotherapy along with \ngemcitabine. Nevertheless, the use of immunotherapy on \nits own enhanced the quantity of cancer antigen–target-\ning CTLs while decreasing the presence of Tregs [391]. \nIn  vivo, the induction of anti-tumor immunity against \npancreatic cancer is achieved through DC vaccines that \nhave been pulsed with alpha-galactosylceramide [392].\nPeptide vaccines\nThe peptide vaccine candidate GV1001 possesses cer-\ntain noteworthy cell-penetrating peptide character-\nistics. GV1001 is generated from a peptide derived \nfrom a reverse-transcriptase portion of telomerase, \nor hTERT. In a phase II study, a significant immune \nresponse was observed in a majority of patients with \nadvanced pancreatic cancer who received GV1001, \nand these immune responders had a notably improved \nmedian survival compared to non-responders [393]. \nHowever, a subsequent phase III clinical trial combin-\ning chemotherapy with the GV1001 vaccine did not \nyield a significant improvement in OS [394]. Another \npeptide cancer vaccine, KIF20A-66, was also examined \nin a phase I/II trial and found to be well-tolerated. The \nmOS and median progression-free survival (mPFS) \nwere reported as 142 days and 56 days, respectively \n[395]. Recently, the phase 1 study of ELI-002 2P in \npatients with KRAS-mutated pancreatic cancer dem-\nonstrated promising results. ELI-002 2P is a cancer \nvaccine that specifically targets lymph nodes and con-\nsists of three components. These components include \nmodified G12D and G12R mKRAS long peptides, \nwhich have been modified with amphiphiles, and an \namphiphile-modified TLR9 agonistic CpG-7909 DNA. \nThe therapy was well-tolerated, induced significant \nT-cell responses, and resulted in biomarker clearance \nand improved relapse-free survival. These findings sug-\ngest that ELI-002 2P has the potential to be an effective \ntreatment option for patients with immunotherapy-\nrecalcitrant KRAS-mutated tumors [396].\nDNA vaccines\nSeveral studies have shown that DNA vaccines target-\ning TAAs can effectively prolong survival in mice with \nPDAC. Targeting α-Enolase (ENO1) with a DNA vac-\ncine has been particularly effective [397]. In addition, \ncombining this DNA vaccine with chemotherapy using \ngemcitabine has shown improved efficacy against mul-\ntiple TAAs, including ENO1, glyceraldeheyde-3-phos-\nphate dehydrogenase (G3P), keratin, type II cytoskeletal \n8 (K2C8), and far upstream binding protein 1 (FUBP1) \n[398]. Another DNA vaccine targeting mucin 1-vari-\nable number tandem repeat (MUC1-VNTRn) has dem-\nonstrated strong cytotoxic effects in both in  vivo and \nin  vitro experiments [399]. Furthermore, a chimeric \nDNA vaccine that targets human fibroblast activation \nprotein alpha (FAPα) and survivin has been shown to \nreduce immunosuppressive cells and increase TILs, \nthereby creating a more favorable TME for immune \nresponses against pancreatic tumors [400]."}, {"page_number": 34, "text": "Page 34 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \nRNA vaccines\nPersonalized cancer vaccines made of mRNA include \nmRNA that encodes specific tumor-specific antigens \n(TSAs) and TAAs. Subsequently, APCs take in the \nmRNA and exhibit the matching peptide antigens, which \nprompts immune responses encompassing CTLs and \nmemory T cells. RO7198457, also known as BNT122, \nrepresents an mRNA-based cancer vaccine that aims \nto elicit T-cell-triggered immune reactions against \ntumor neo-antigens. Various clinical studies are sched-\nuled to be conducted among individuals diagnosed \nwith diverse types of cancer, such as pancreatic can-\ncer (NCT04161755 and NCT05968326), solid tumors \n(NCT03289962), melanoma (NCT03815058), and colon \ncancer (NCT04486378). However, many of these trials’ \nresults have not been released yet. Next, the outcomes of \nthe clinical trial NCT04161755 are explained.\nAn mRNA vaccine called autogene cevumeran was \ngenerated using uridine mRNA-lipoplex nanoparticles. \nAfter the surgical procedure, a combination therapy \nthat included atezolizumab, the mRNA vaccine (with a \nmaximum of 20 neo-antigens per patient), and chemo-\ntherapy was conducted. The results indicated that vac-\ncine-enhanced T cells, which accounted for as much \nas 10% of the total T cells in the bloodstream, experi-\nenced re-expansion through a vaccine booster. These re-\nexpanded cells consisted of durable, polyfunctional ­CD8+ \nT cells that targeted pancreatic cancer neo-antigens. \nAfter a median follow-up period of 18 months, patients \nwho exhibited vaccine-enhanced T cells demonstrated a \nsignificantly prolonged median recurrence-free survival \nwhen compared to the control group [401].\nViral/bacterial vector‑based vaccines\nThese cancer vaccines use modified viruses or bacteria \nas vectors to deliver genetic code for tumor antigens into \nhuman cells. The infected cells then produce tumor anti-\ngens, which trigger an immune response in the host. The \nbacterial vector can be used to treat castration-resistant \nprostate cancer, and the bacterial-based cancer vaccine \nhas shown promising anti-tumor effects in clinical tri-\nals [402]. One of the widely recognized cancer vaccines \nof this kind is CRS207, which is a live attenuated strain \nof Listeria monocytogenes engineered to express MSLN. \nThe utilization of the CRS207 vaccine in individuals \ndiagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer has demon-\nstrated promising outcomes in terms of prolonged sur-\nvival rates while causing minimal detrimental effects to \npatients [41]. The utilization of an exogenous immuniza-\ntion antigen, administered via Salmonella bacteria acting \nas a vector, effectively redirects the attention of ­CD8+ T \ncells towards cancer cells within the cytoplasm of tumor \ncells. Consequently, this approach leads to the complete \neradication of pancreatic tumors, the enhancement of \nanti-tumor immunity, and a significant extension in sur-\nvival duration, as demonstrated in PDAC mouse models \n[403]. Moreover, VEGFR-2, a target for anti-angiogenic \nintervention, is expressed on tumor vasculature. VXM01, \nan oral tumor vaccine using attenuated Salmonella with \na VEGFR-2 expression plasmid, was tested in a phase I \ntrial with advanced pancreatic cancer patients. The study \nfound that VXM01 was well tolerated, with no dose-\nlimiting toxicities and significant increases in VEGFR2-\nspecific T effector responses. Vaccinated patients showed \nreduced tumor perfusion and elevated serum biomarkers \nindicative of anti-angiogenic activity, which correlated \nwith preexisting VEGFR2-specific T-cell levels [404].\nStem cell‑based vaccines\nThe fact that cancer cells and embryonic tissues have \nseveral similar cellular and molecular characteristics sug-\ngests that we can potentially utilize iPSCs to stimulate \nanti-tumor responses within cancer vaccines. Indeed, \niPSCs share gene expression profiles with tumor cells. \nThe prevention of tumor growth in murine breast can-\ncer, mesothelioma, and melanoma models is achieved by \niPSC vaccines. Acting as an adjuvant, the iPSC vaccine \neffectively hinders the reoccurrence of melanoma and \ndecreases the spread of tumors [405]. Research demon-\nstrates that a cancer vaccine derived from iPSCs stimu-\nlates a defensive immune response in a PDAC mouse \nmodel. Furthermore, this immune response is linked to \nheightened ­CD8+ effector and memory T cell reactions \nagainst tumor cells, the generation of antibodies specifi-\ncally targeting cancer cells, and a reduction in immuno-\nsuppressive Tregs composed of ­CD4+ T cells [406].\nStrategies based on targeting myeloid cells and CAFs\nIn this section, our primary objective is to elucidate the \ntherapeutic potential associated with specifically tar-\ngeting myeloid cells in the context of pancreatic cancer \n(Table 8).\nTargeting macrophages\nTherapies that retrain macrophages to engulf and destroy \ntumor cells may provide a new approach to treating \ncancer. Antibodies that stimulate the phagocytic pro-\ngram in macrophages were initially found in pancreatic \ncancer patients treated with anti-CD40 agonistic anti-\nbodies [407]. It was believed that these antibodies only \naffected macrophages, but further research showed they \nalso improved the function of DCs and T-cell priming \n[408, 409]. However, a phase II trial found that an anti-\nCD40 antibody called APX005M (sotigalimab) did not \nimprove clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients,"}, {"page_number": 35, "text": "Page 35 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

As mentioned earlier, CD47 is a pro-\ntein found on cancer cells that prevents them from being \nengulfed by macrophages. However, blocking CD47 \nalone does not have a significant effect on some types \nof solid tumors [411]. Macrophages can be stimulated \nto have anti-cancer properties, including engulfing can-\ncer cells expressing CD47, by using a specific molecule, \nCpG oligodeoxynucleotide (an agonist for the TLR9) \n[412]. The utilization of a specific TLR9 ligand known \nas K3-SPG for in  situ vaccination prompts a durable \nimmune response and enhances the effects of both local \nand systemic immunotherapy in preclinical models [413], \nwhich may be associated with overcoming T-cell exhaus-\ntion [414]. Moreover, signal transduction by the CSF-1R \nin macrophages could be a useful target for improving \nthe immune response in pancreatic tumors and enhanc-\ning the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Blocking the \nCSF1/CSF-1R pathway eliminates TAMs from tumors \nand reprograms remaining macrophages to enhance \nanti-tumor immunity. This blockage improves interferon \nresponses, increases infiltration of CTLs, and prevents \ntumor growth [159]. In a trial investigating the safety \nand immunologic impact of GVAX in combination with \ncyclophosphamide, pembrolizumab, and IMC-CS4 (a \nCSF-1R inhibitor), nine patients were enrolled, with two \nexperiencing severe immune-related side effects (diar-\nrhea and rash). The study reported a median DFS of \n12.6 months and OS of 20.4 months, with 78% achieving \nmajor pathological response post-surgery. The primary \nimmunologic endpoint was met, with 75% of patients \nshowing a significant increase in ­CD8+ T cells and gran-\nzyme ­B+ ­CD8+ T cells following triple therapy. No sig-\nnificant change in myeloid cell density was observed, \nsuggesting macrophages were reprogrammed rather than \ndepleted (NCT03153410) [415].\nPDAC is a type of cancer that spreads to the liver with \nthe help of macrophages. The process of macrophages \nengulfing dead cells, known as efferocytosis, promotes \nliver metastasis by changing the macrophages. A protein \ncalled progranulin in macrophages affects their ability to \nbreak down cells, leading to a change in the macrophages \nand an increase in arginase 1 levels. Blocking efferocy-\ntosis or reducing progranulin levels can decrease liver \nmetastasis and enhance the function of ­CD8+ T cells \n[416]. Targeting these mechanisms may prevent the \nspread of PDAC to the liver.\nTargeting CAFs\nAlthough previous attempts to target CAFs in PDAC have \nfailed, there is renewed interest in targeting subgroups \nof fibroblasts or their secreted products. Schwann cells \nprovoke CAFs in the microenvironment of PDAC [417]. \nSuppressing stromal TGF-βR2 leads to a decrease in IL-6 \nproduction from CAFs, which in turn results in dimin-\nished STAT3 activation in tumor cells and a reversal of \nthe immunosuppressive environment [418]. Also, In vivo \nneutralization of TGF-β remodels CAF dynamics, reduc-\ning myofibroblasts and promoting interferon-responsive \nfibroblasts. This enhances anti-tumor immunity and the \neffectiveness of PD-1 immunotherapy [419].\nIt is suggested that vitamin D might play a role in \ninducing a state of rest or inactivity in fibroblasts. A study \nindicates that the stroma of human pancreatic tumors \ncontains the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Using calcipo-\ntriol, a ligand of VDR, as a treatment significantly reduces \ninflammation and fibrosis in both pancreatitis and tumor \nstroma. The study demonstrates that VDR plays a crucial \nrole as a transcriptional regulator of PSCs, aiding them to \nrevert to a dormant state. This results in stromal altera-\ntions, enhanced intratumoral delivery of the chemother-\napy drug gemcitabine, a decrease in tumor size, and a \nsurvival rate increase of 57% compared to chemotherapy \nalone [420]. In light of this finding, two phase II clinical \ntrials are currently in progress for patients with PDAC. \nThe first trial (NCT03520790) aims to combine paricalci-\ntol with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, while the second \ntrial (NCT02754726) seeks to combine nivolumab with \ngemcitabine, paclitaxel, and cisplatin. These trials are \nactively recruiting participants to further investigate the \npotential benefits of these treatment approaches.\nIL-1β has multiple effects on the TME, including pro-\nmoting the development of CAFs. These CAFs, in turn, \nproduce IL-6, which creates an environment that helps \ntumors evade the immune system and allows tumor cells \nto survive for longer [231, 421]. Not only immune cells, \nbut PDAC tumor cells themselves can also produce IL-1β. \nIn preclinical studies, blocking IL-1β has shown promis-\ning results when combined with blocking PD-1 [422]. A \nphase I clinical trial (NCT04581343) evaluated the effi-\ncacy of combining gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with \ntwo antibodies—one that blocks IL-1β (canakinumab) \nand another that blocks PD-1 (spartalizumab). The most \ncommon severe AEs (Grade 3/4) included neutropenia \n(60%) and anemia (50%), with no fatalities. One patient \ndiscontinued spartalizumab due to grade 3 pneumonitis. \nThere were 3 confirmed partial responses, 5 patients with \nstable disease, and 2 patients with disease progression as \ntheir best response (n = 10), and a 1-year OS rate of 60% \nwas reported. Both patients who responded and those \nwho did not showed ­CD8+ T cell activation in periph-\neral blood and increased serum levels of IFN-induced \nchemokines CXCL9/10 [423].\nCAFs have elevated levels of the protein PIN1. PIN1 \npromotes several cancer-related pathways by affecting \nthe structure of phosphorylated proteins. Blocking PIN1"}, {"page_number": 37, "text": "Page 37 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

Sev-\neral small molecule drugs, such as all-trans retinoic acid \n(ATRA), have been identified as PIN1 inhibitors and have \nbeen used to study their functions in cancer development \n[424, 425]. Clinical trials have shown positive results \nwhen combining ATRA with chemotherapy in patients \nwith advanced pancreatic cancer [426]. PIN1 inhibi-\ntion also reduces the formation of fibrous tissue within \ntumors and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. \nIn addition, PIN1 inhibition may enhance the effective-\nness of immunotherapy [425, 427]. Animal models have \ndemonstrated reduced tumor growth when treated with \na combination of a PIN1 inhibitor AG17724, an antibody \nagainst FAPα, and DNA aptamers that recruit specific \nimmune cells [424].\nPlacental growth factor (PlGF) is a protein expressed \nmainly in the placenta. Blocking PlGF in animal mod-\nels of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma led to improved \nsurvival by decreasing desmoplasia and enriching qui-\nescent CAFs [428]. PlGF also promotes liver fibrosis, \ntumor angiogenesis, and cancer cell metastasis [429]. In \npancreatic cancer, PlGF is upregulated by chemotherapy, \nleading to the generation of extracellular matrix by CAFs. \nCombining atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 mAb) with \nPlGF/VEGF inhibition targeting ­CD141+ CAFs enhances \nthe efficacy of chemotherapy [429].\nReprogramming DCs\nThe restoration of the expression of peptide-MHC com-\nplexes and co-stimulatory molecules is achieved through \nDC reprogramming. This reprogramming enabled the \ndisplay of tumor antigens originating within the context \nof MHC-I, ultimately enhancing the targeted elimina-\ntion by ­CD8+ CTLs [430]. Studies in mice have demon-\nstrated that cDCs play a crucial role in initiating immune \nresponses specific to tumors by ­CD8+ T lymphocytes. \nHowever, pancreatic cancer lacks an adequate presence of \nthese cDCs [130, 431]. In comparison to lung adenocarci-\nnoma mouse models, models of PDAC displayed a nota-\nble scarcity of ­CD103+ cDCs. Following treatment with \nFMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), which aug-\nments the number of intratumoral cDCs, mouse models \nof PDAC showed renewed sensitivity to CD40 agonist \nantibody and radiation therapy [431]. Currently, a trial \nis being conducted to investigate the potential of com-\nbining CDX-1140, a CD40 agonist antibody, with FLT3L \n(CDX-301) in patients with PDAC (NCT03329950).\nThe activation of DCs can be provoked by the death of \ntumor cells, and the subsequent ingestion of fragments \nfrom these tumor cells also triggers regulatory processes \nin DCs that hinder their interaction with T cells. By sub-\njecting DCs to microbial products that stimulate TLR \nsignaling, such as pIpC or CpG DNA, which imitate viral \nnucleic acid, this regulatory function can be bypassed. \nHence, innate immune adjuvants are incorporated into \nvaccination strategies. Additionally, targeted medications \nthat affect the pathways of DNA replication and repair \ncan activate the STING pathway, which subsequently \nstimulates the production of IFN-I and enhances the acti-\nvation of DCs [432, 433]. As a result, in animal models of \npancreatic cancer, the administration of STING agonists \nboosts inflammation in the surrounding immune envi-\nronment and reduces tumor load [434]. Moreover, using \n­PtIV-MSA-2 conjugates containing cisplatin and a STING \nagonist is effective against pancreatic cancer, leading \nto increased immune cell infiltration and activation in \ntumor tissues [435].\nThe enforcement of expression of the transcription \nfactors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 (PIB) is adequate to \ntrigger the cDC1 phenotype. By this reprogramming \nthrough PIB, cancer cells are transformed into capable \nAPCs, offering an approach to counteract the strate-\ngies employed by tumors to evade immune surveillance. \nThese reprogrammed DCs were capable of presenting \nendogenous tumor antigens on MHC-I and facilitating \ntargeted killing by ­CD8+ T cells [430].\nTargeting immunosuppressive MDSCs\nThere is significant synergy between PD-1 blockade and \nthe CD11b agonist as it substantially decreases the accu-\nmulation of the majority of myeloid cell types in PDAC \nmice models [436]. Furthermore, CD11b agonists like \nGB1275 cause reprogramming of the innate immune \nsystem, leading to an enhanced response of pancreatic \ncancer to immunotherapies [341]. Mice that were admin-\nistered CCR2 inhibitors specifically aimed at circulating \nmonocytes experienced a reduction in the PDAC tumor \nload [153]. A study found the ideal dose of the CCR2 \ninhibitor PF-04136309 to be used alongside chemother-\napy in a clinical trial for pancreatic cancer patients. The \ncombination therapy was found to be safe and well-tol-\nerated by the patients. The study also discovered that the \ninhibitor caused monocytes to accumulate in the bone \nmarrow of patients, leading to a decrease in circulating \nmonocytes and M-MDSCs in the TME. This resulted in \nsignificant reductions in the size of the primary tumors \n[437]. Nevertheless, the combination of nab-paclitaxel/\ngemcitabine along with PF-04136309 resulted in notable \npulmonary toxicity and failed to demonstrate a favorable \nindication [438]. The signaling of CXCR2 is found to be \nincreased in myeloid cells. The absence of CXCR2 leads \nto a decrease in metastasis and its inhibition extends the \nperiod of survival without tumors in mice. Also, the sup-\npression of CXCR2 improves the infiltration of T cells"}, {"page_number": 38, "text": "Page 38 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \nand makes them more responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy \n[439].\nGut microbiome in modulating immune \ncheckpoint blockade\nPreclinical research on mice with sarcoma, mela-\nnoma, and colon cancer revealed that the most effective \nresponses to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1 treatments \nwere reliant on the existence of certain species of gut \nbacteria. This underscores the connection between the \ngut microbiome and the success of immune checkpoint \ntherapy [440–444]. The connection between certain gut \nbacteria and the immune response has also been noted in \nindividuals with cancer. These bacteria impact the opera-\ntion and maturation of immune cells in lymph nodes \nor within the TME, thus dictating the success of ICB \n[445]. Specific gut bacteria have been identified to affect \nimmune responses in cancer. For instance, Bacteroides \nfragilis can trigger TH1 responses and assist in the devel-\nopment of DCs in tumors, enhancing the effectiveness \nof anti-CTLA-4 treatment. Bifidobacterium can modify \nthe activation of DCs and amplify the activity of ­CD8+ T \ncells that are specific to the tumor. Akkermansia mucin-\niphila can augment the penetration of particular ­CD4+ T \ncells into tumors and elevate the proportion of effector \nto regulatory ­CCR9+CXCR3+CD4+ T cells [22, 440, 441, \n446].\nThe fact that pancreatic cancer tissues contain a \nunique microbial fingerprint that aids in acquiring can-\ncer characteristics and influences the long-term survival \nof patients has now been widely accepted and acknowl-\nedged [447–449]. Pancreatic cancer progression and \nthe effect of particular treatments have been linked to \nseparated alterations observable in the microbiome of \nthe gut and tumor [442, 450, 451]. For instance, a trypto-\nphan metabolite derived from tryptophan by gut micro-\nbiota, known as indole-3-acetic acid (3-IAA), is linked \nto improved responses to treatment. Alterations in diet \nor the administration of 3-IAA enhanced the effective-\nness of chemotherapy in mouse models of PDAC. This \neffectiveness is associated with myeloperoxidase, which \noxidizes 3-IAA, resulting in an increase in ROS and a \ndecrease in autophagy in cancer cells, thereby inhibiting \ntheir proliferation [452]. In another study, the oncogenic \nmutation KRAS G12D boosts IL-33 production, pro-\nmoting type 2 immunity in PDAC. The tumor’s mycobi-\nome further increases IL-33 secretion. This IL-33 then \nrecruits and activates TH2 cells and innate lymphoid cells \n2 (ILC2s) in the PDAC TME. Remarkably, either deleting \nIL-33 genetically or administering anti-fungal treatment \nleads to PDAC tumor regression [453]. This highlights \nthe crucial roles of IL-33 and the tumor’s mycobiome in \nPDAC progression and potential treatment strategies.\nMultiple studies conducted on murine models of \nPDAC have demonstrated that eliminating the gut \nmicrobiome with antimicrobial agents could poten-\ntially amplify the susceptibility of tumors to ICIs and \ndiminish the overall burden of tumors [70, 454, 455]. \nWhile the majority of the literature concentrates on the \npotential employment of microbiota-centered interven-\ntions together with chemotherapy and ICB, it emerges \nas plausible that microbiome modulation may also be \nemployed concurrently with CAR T cells, antibody–\ndrug conjugates, and immunotherapies that are yet to \nbe established [456]. A multitude of current research \nand clinical trials are exploring the possibility of modi-\nfying the microbiome to boost the efficacy of ICB. It has \nbeen demonstrated that fecal microbial transplantation \ncan enhance ICB outcomes and reduce associated AEs \nin patients [457–459]. Furthermore, altering the diet is \na potential approach to adjust the gut microbiome, and \nan increasing number of preclinical studies indicate its \npotential to enhance the response to ICB [460].\nA study suggests that the composition of the tumor \nmicrobiome in resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma \npatients plays a significant role in long-term survival. \nThe higher alpha-diversity in the tumor microbiome of \nlong-term survivors and the identified microbiome sig-\nnature predictive of long-term survivorship highlight \nthe importance of the tumor microbiota in influenc-\ning the natural history of the disease. Furthermore, the \nfindings from fecal microbiota transplantation experi-\nments demonstrate the ability to modulate the tumor \nmicrobiome and affect tumor growth and immune infil-\ntration, indicating the potential for targeted interven-\ntions to improve patient outcomes [459]. Moreover, in \nindividuals with pancreatic cancers, a higher presence \nof Megasphaera within the tumor has been linked to \nimproved survival rates following anti-PD-1 therapy \n[461]. Additionally, bacterial elimination in PDAC \nleads to immune changes, reducing MDSCs, promot-\ning ­CD8+ T-cell activation, and increasing differen-\ntiation of TH1 cells and M1 macrophages. This also \nenhances immunotherapy effectiveness by increasing \nPD-1 expression. The PDAC microbiome induces TLRs \ndriven-T cell anergy, suggesting the microbiome’s role \nin immune suppression and its potential as a therapeu-\ntic target [70].\nAll in all, the association of pancreatic cancer with gut \nand tumor microbiome in the context of cancer immu-\nnotherapy is an interesting research area in treatment, \nprognosis, and predicting response to immunotherapy. \nApproaches like modulating the gut microbiome, fecal \nmicrobial transplantation, and dietary regimen-ori-\nented interventions might improve the clinical outcome \nin patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy."}, {"page_number": 39, "text": "Page 39 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

The combination \nof CRISPR/Cas9 and cancer immunotherapy may fur-\nther broaden the application of immunotherapy to more \ncancer patients, and ongoing clinical trials are using the \nCRISPR/Cas9 system in immune cells to modify genomes \nin a target-specific manner. The CRISPR/Cas9 system’s \nability to create site-specific, highly efficient gene knock-\nout makes it a desirable tool to address long-standing \nchallenges in cancer treatment, such as T cell exhaustion \nand TME immunosuppression [462, 463]. In the context \nof pancreatic cancer, there are numerous studies utilizing \nCRISPR/Cas9 for gene knockout (Fig. 5) [464–468]. The \nutilization of CRISPR/Cas9 methodology to disrupt the \nCD73 gene in both human and murine cellular models \nof pancreatic cancer demonstrated that CD73 inactiva-\ntion impeded cellular proliferation and motility, leading \nto a halt in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, it \nwas observed that deletion of CD73 hindered the ERK/\nSTAT3 signaling pathway while stimulating the E-cad-\nherin pathway [469]. A study found that mesenchymal-\nlike pancreatic cancer cells are more resistant to immune \ncell-mediated killing than the parental epithelial-like \ncells. In this study, the researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 \nknockout screens to identify the genes involved in this \nresistance. They discovered several mesenchymal-specific \nregulators, such as Egfr and Mfge8, that were responsible \nfor inhibiting immune cell function [470]. The applica-\ntion of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce targeted \nBRCA1/2 mutations enables the reinstatement of olapa-\nrib responsiveness in pancreatic cancer cells [471]. Apart \nfrom potential challenges and limitations of CRISPR/\nCas9 such as off-target toxicity, Cas9-related immuno-\ngenicity, and off-target mutations, these studies highlight \nthe useful application of this genome editing tool in the \ncontext of pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.\nFig. 5  The emerging role of genome editing technology CRISPR/Cas9 in pancreatic cancer treatment.

Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \nPotential strategies improving efficacy \nof pancreatic cancer immunotherapies\nCombination therapy\nPancreatic cancer presents a range of mechanisms that \nresist immunotherapy. Therapies that target only one \nmechanism have not yielded successful results. The \nresearch proposes the optimization of the benefits of \ncurrent agents through logical combinations. The sug-\ngested approach for advanced immunotherapy for PDAC \ninvolves combinations that amplify immune activation, \ninhibit immune checkpoints, improve the TME, and are \ncompatible with conventional cytotoxic therapy [472, \n473]. There are a plethora of combination therapies for \ncancer immunotherapy of PDAC (Tables 5, 7, 8, 9). For \nexample, BMS-687681, which acts as a dual antagonist \nfor CCR2/5, was used in conjunction with anti-PD-1 \nand radiotherapy. The results indicated an increase in \nthe infiltration of intratumoral effector and memory T \ncells, while simultaneously observing a decrease in the \ninfiltration of Tregs, M2 TAMs, and MDSCs [474]. Over-\nall, combination therapies could improve the efficacy of \nimmunotherapies due to providing a potential for syner-\ngistic effects.\nCostimulatory molecule agonists\nCD40 activation and using CD40 agonists are a novel \nclinical opportunity for cancer immunotherapy [407, \n475–478]. There are several agonistic anti-CD40 anti-\nbodies, such as SGN-40, SEA-CD40, selicrelumab, \nAPX005M, CDX-1140, and ADC1013, applicable in \nclinical trials [477]. In a phase I clinical trial, the com-\nbination of an agonistic anti-CD40 antibody and gem-\ncitabine for treating PDAC was tested. The treatment \nshowed only a slight effect, but its safety was confirmed \n[479]. The combination of the CD40 agonist and gem-\ncitabine could potentially overcome resistance to anti-\nPD-1/CTLA-4 therapy by increasing the accumulation \nof ­CD8+ T cells that fight against tumors in PDAC [480]. \nA study found that selicrelumab (an agonist CD40 anti-\nbody) significantly altered the TME in PDAC patients. \nSelicrelumab-treated tumors were enriched with T cells \n(82%) compared to untreated (37%) and chemotherapy/\nchemoradiation-treated tumors (23%). Additionally, \nselicrelumab reduced tumor fibrosis, decreased M2-like \ntumor-associated macrophages, and matured intratu-\nmoral DCs. The treatment had an acceptable toxicity \nprofile and resulted in an overall survival of 23.4 months \n[475]. Moreover, a study demonstrates that using a nano-\nfluidic drug-eluting seed (NDES) for sustained, low-dose \nintratumoral delivery of CD40 monoclonal antibody can \nalter the TME and reduce tumor size in mouse models \nof PDAC [478]. These findings elucidate the therapeutic \nmechanisms of CD40 targeting and modification of the \nTME in pancreatic cancer, aiming to enhance the effec-\ntiveness of immunotherapies against cold tumors like \nPDAC.\nNeutralizing tumor acidity\nAcidosis plays a significant role as an immunosuppres-\nsive mechanism that contributes to the proliferation of \nPDAC and immune escape [481]. A study investigates \nthe application of L-DOS47, a urease immuno-conjugate, \nfor the purpose of neutralizing the acidity of tumors and \nenhancing the response to immunotherapy. L-DOS47 \nattaches to CEACAM6, a protein that is predominantly \npresent in gastrointestinal cancers, and increases the \nlocal pH by breaking down urea into two NH4 + and one \nCO2. This was experimented on a model of pancreatic \ntumors in mice, and it was observed that L-DOS47 ele-\nvated the extracellular pH of the tumor. When L-DOS47 \nwas used in conjunction with anti-PD-1, it significantly \nboosted the effectiveness of the monotherapy, leading \nto a reduction in tumor growth for a duration of up to 4 \nweeks [482]. This study paves the way for using L-DOS47 \nin future clinical trials.\nTargeting desmoplastic barriers of TME\nA significant obstacle to the effectiveness of cancer \nimmunotherapies in PDAC is the presence of desmoplas-\ntic barriers within the stromal ECM, such as hyaluronan. \nThese mechanical barriers encapsulate the tumor cells, \nthereby restricting their exposure to immunotherapeutic \nagents. The targeted removal of hyaluronan in a mouse \nmodel of PDAC resulted in better vascular permeability \nand enhanced drug delivery. This led to increased effec-\ntiveness of chemotherapy when combined with the cyto-\ntoxic chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine [483]. A study \nfound that combining PEGPH20 (a PEGylated recom-\nbinant human hyaluronidase), focal adhesion kinase \ninhibitor, and anti-PD-1 antibody treatments improved \nsurvival in PDAC-bearing mice, increased T-cell infiltra-\ntion, altered T-cell phenotype and metabolism, reduced \ngranulocytes, and decreased CXCR4-expressing mye-\nloid cells. Additionally, adding an anti-CXCR4 antibody \nsignificantly reduced metastatic rates in a PDAC liver \nmetastasis model [484].\nInnate immune activation\nA useful strategy in combating pancreatic cancer involves \nthe stimulation of the body’s innate immune system to \nbolster its anti-cancer defenses. This is accomplished \nby, for instance, utilizing a genetically altered version \nof Listeria monocytogenes, which is engineered to pro-\nduce MSLN. Alongside this, a vaccine named GVAX \nis used.

This therapeutic approach transforms PDACs \ninto a state that is more receptive to immune responses. \nThis change is marked by a rise in T cell infiltration and \nthe formation of tertiary lymphoid clusters within the \ntumors [380], likely converting the cold tumor into the \nhot tumor. Innate immune cells use cGAS to trigger \ninflammatory signals when they bind to the pathogen or \ndamage-related molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs). \nThis process leads to the production of cGAMP and the \nactivation of STING, a protein in the endoplasmic reticu-\nlum, which then promotes cellular gene programs result-\ning in the production of IFN-I [486, 487]. IFNs-I (IFN-α \nand IFN-β) are essential for the development of ­CD8+ T \ncells that fight against tumors. Tumors that are inflamed \nwith T cells, often referred to as “hot” tumors, have been \nlinked to a transcriptional signature of type 1 interferon \n[488, 489]. The activation of STING, either systemically \nor within the tumor, through STING agonists, has been \nshown to reverse immune-suppression and cause tumor \nshrinkage in various preclinical cancer studies [434, \n490–494]. IACS-8803 (a STING agonist) increases sen-\nsitivity to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy \nin the orthotopic PDAC models [495]. Furthermore, \na STING agonist called IMSA101 boosts CAR T cell \nfunction in a mouse pancreatic tumor model, which is \nfacilitated through STING agonist-induced IL-18 secre-\ntion [496]. All in all, the STING innate immune sensing \npathway, when activated, could potentially transform \ntumors lacking T cell infiltrates into tumors with infiltrat-\ning T cells, and thus offers a promising target in PDAC \nimmunotherapy.\nTME‑modulating agents\nA successful immunotherapy for PDAC usually requires \ncombining different treatments to help T cells infiltrate \nand stay activated in the hostile TME. Current research \nis focused on developing strategies to improve the PDAC \nTME, boost the immune response, and enhance the \neffectiveness of T cell therapy [44, 497].\nADH-503 is a small molecule that binds to CD11b and \nenhances the adhesion of myeloid cells, inhibiting their \nmigration into tissues [498]. It also shifts TAM polari-\nzation to an anti-tumor phenotype, improves survival \nin PDAC-bearing mice, and sensitizes PDAC tumors to \nanti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy [341]. In clinical trials, \nADH-503 was well tolerated with common side effects, \nbut no clinical responses were observed in pancreatic \ncancer patients (NCT04060342) [499].\nIn PDAC, it is expected that targeting the CCL2/\nCCR2 pathway would help to reduce the accumulation \nof TAMs in the TME. A CCR2 inhibitor, PF-04136309, \nwas tested in combination with chemotherapy in patients \nwith pancreatic cancer. A manageable level of safety was \nobserved. Early correlational studies indicated a decrease \nin TAMs and an increase in TILs (NCT01413022) [437]. \nAnother trial combining PF-04136309 with chemother-\napy in pancreatic cancer patients showed high rates of \nlung toxicity and no significant improvement in efficacy \n(NCT02732938) [438]. A study tested the CCR2 antag-\nonist CCX872-B in combination with FOLFIRINOX \nfor patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Analysis \nshowed an OS rate of 29% at 18 months with no safety \nconcerns (NCT02345408) [500]. BMS-813160 is a dual \nantagonist for CCR2 and CCR5 that is being tested in \ncombination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy in \npatients with advanced pancreatic or colorectal cancer, \nbut no results from the study have been reported yet \n(NCT03184870) [501].\nSeveral studies have shown that by inhibiting the \nCXCR4/CXCL12 axis, the PDAC TME can be modi-\nfied. For example, when CXCR4 was knocked down, \nthe invasion potential of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro \nwas decreased. Treating fresh human PDAC slices with \na combination of PD-1 and CXCR4 blockade resulted in \nenhanced tumor cell death and lymphocyte expansion \ninto the juxtatumoral compartment [502]. In a mouse \nmodel of PDAC, administering the CXCR4 inhibitor \nAMD3100 (plerixafor) led to the accumulation of T cells \namong cancer cells, resulting in a synergistic tumoricidal \neffect when combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy \n[35]. A trial tested AMD3100 in patients with colorec-\ntal and pancreatic cancer, resulting in decreased tumor \nmarkers (circulating tumor DNA and IL-8) and changes \nin immune cells (reduced number of CAFs and increased \nnumber of effector TILs/NK cells) [503–505]. Motixa-\nfortide (BL-8040; CXCR4 antagonist) is a synthetic pep-\ntide that is administered subcutaneously and has shown \npromising results in combination with pembrolizumab \nin treating metastatic PDAC, increasing ­CD8+ T cell \ninfiltration and decreasing MDSCs and circulating Tregs \n(NCT02826486) [506]. NOX-A12 (olaptesed pegol) is \na PEGylated drug that inhibits CXCL12 and enhances \nthe activity of anti-PD-1 therapy in pre-clinical models \n[507]. In a phase 1/2 study with advanced PDAC patients, \nNOX-A12 in combination with pembrolizumab led to \ninduced TH1 cytokines, prolonged stable disease, and \nincreased effector immune cells in tumor biopsy tissue \n(NCT03168139) [508].\nPharmacologic inhibition of the A2A adenosine recep-\ntor enhances the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 therapy [509]. \nSeveral anti-CD73 therapeutics and adenosine recep-\ntor inhibitors have been developed [510].

When used in conjunction with anti-\nPD-1 treatment, it resulted in the elimination of tumors \nin 60% of animal subjects [511]. Clinical studies of ole-\nclumab, either alone or in combination with durvalumab, \nin patients who did not respond to anti-PD-L1 therapies \nlike advanced pancreatic cancer revealed good tolerabil-\nity and some partial responses (22 and 28 months) in a \nsmall subset of patients (2/73; NCT02503774) [512]. A \nstudy evaluated the safety of quemliclustat (a small mol-\necule inhibitor of CD73) in combination with standard \ntreatment and zimberelimab in patients with metastatic \nPDAC. The safety profile is similar to single agents, \nwith no new toxicities. Some patients showed partial \nresponses with long-lasting effects (NCT04104672) \n[513].\nMain challenges ahead of pancreatic cancer \nimmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy for pancreatic cancer is a significant \ntherapeutic strategy. However, despite comprehensive \nstudies, there are obstacles in translating research out-\ncomes and determining the best therapeutic combina-\ntions. These challenges necessitate a joint effort from \nscientists and medical practitioners to deepen our com-\nprehension of the interactions between cancer and the \nimmune system and to enhance the treatment choices \navailable to patients. In this part, we will explore in \ngreater detail the chief hurdles facing immunotherapeu-\ntic strategies for pancreatic cancer.\nLow antigenic strength and number of neo‑antigens\nDuring the process of tumor development, non-synon-\nymous gene mutations occur, leading to the generation \nof neo-antigens that are exclusively expressed by tumor \ncells. Pancreatic cancers carry a moderate load of these \nnon-synonymous neo-antigenic mutations [497]. In \nessence, PDACs show a low load of neo-epitopes; there-\nfore, the tumors are more likely to adapt to immune \npressure and escape T cell-mediated killing through \ncancer immunoediting. In a study, T cell immunity \nwas assessed in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, \nrevealing a low level of mutations, no anticipated neo-\nepitopes resulting from these mutations, and resistance \nto respond to checkpoint immunotherapy [514]. Also, \npancreatic tumors that have the greatest quantity of \nneo-antigens and the highest concentration of ­CD8+ \nT cell infiltrates are linked to the longest survival rates \nin patients. Moreover, enrichment of neo-antigens in \nthe tumor antigen MUC16 (CA125) was observed in \nlong-term survivors of pancreatic cancer [53]. Thus, the \nquality of neo-antigens as a biomarker for PDAC could \npotentially steer the use of immunotherapies [53, 515]. \nAdditionally, the BCL2A1 neo-epitope is presented as \na potential target for personalized immunotherapy, \nwhich stimulates CTLs to combat pancreatic cancer \ncells [516]. All in all, neo-antigens might broaden the \nhorizon towards personalized immunotherapy of pan-\ncreatic cancer. A major challenge restricting their appli-\ncability, however, is that a low number of neo-antigens \nis rarely shared among patients [497], making the use of \nrelevant treatment approaches cumbersome and costly.\nPrimary, adaptive, and acquired resistance\nIn primary resistance, there can be instances where can-\ncer does not respond to immunotherapy, potentially due \nto adaptive immune resistance mechanisms. Adaptive \nresistance pertains to a resistance strategy where the \ncancer, even though identified by the immune system, \nshields itself by adjusting to the immune attack. Lastly, \nacquired resistance refers to a situation where a cancer \ninitially shows a response to immunotherapy, but after \na certain period, it experiences a relapse and advances \n[517]. From a biological perspective, resistance to immu-\nnotherapy can be linked to both intrinsic factors in tumor \ncells and extrinsic factors associated with TME like \nECM and stroma-derived factors, immune cells/factors, \nand intratumoral microbiota. Tumor cell-intrinsic fac-\ntors include genetic/epigenetic defects, IFN-γ signaling, \nlack of neo-antigens, oncogenic signaling pathways, and \nepigenetic reprogramming [22]. ­FAP+ CAFs hinder the \nanti-tumor activity of T cells in pancreatic cancer. How-\never, directing therapies towards these ­FAP+ subtypes \nimproves the tumor’s response to anti-PD-L1 [35]. T-cell \nexclusion is a process that resists immune checkpoint \ntherapy, and it’s particularly noticeable in ‘cold’ tumors \nlike pancreatic cancer, which have a low presence of T \ncells in TME. Some cancer-causing pathways might allow \ntumors to use this method to avoid the immune system. \nFor instance, the activation of Wnt/β-catenin within the \ntumor cells has been demonstrated to result in the exclu-\nsion of T cells from the TME [518, 519]. Moreover, PTEN \ndeficiency is linked to provoke PI3K-AKT pathway sign-\naling and is connected to decreased presence of ­CD8+ \nT cells and unfavorable clinical outcomes from immu-\nnotherapy [520]. A recent study found that the loss of \ninterferon regulatory factor 6 (Irf6) leads to resistance to \nimmunotherapy, and its re-expression improves immu-\nnotherapy responses to PDAC [521]. All in all, the resist-\nance to immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer is complex \nand influenced by both internal and external factors \nwithin the tumor. A sophisticated strategy of basic and \ntranslational/clinical research is needed to understand \nthese mechanisms and identify tumor-specific resistance \npatterns."}, {"page_number": 45, "text": "Page 45 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \n\t\nImmune‑related adverse events (irAEs)\nThe irAEs are diverse and can affect any organ. Different \nimmunotherapy regimens have unique toxicity patterns \nlike CRS and neurologic toxicities, making understand-\ning their mechanisms crucial [522–525]. However, a \npositive association exists between the occurrence of \nnon-lethal irAEs and the response to ICB [526]. Mild \n(Grade 1–2) effects are observed in over 90% of patients, \nwhereas severe (Grades 3–5) effects can occur in 20–60% \nof patients [527]. Studies highlight the role of certain \nimmune cells such as ­CD8+ tissue-resident memory T \ncells and neutrophils, and cytokines like IFN-γ and IL-6 \nin causing immunotherapy-induced colitis [528–530]. \nOther mechanisms like loss of self-tolerance, molecular \nmimicry, and inflammation also contribute to irAEs. For \nexample, in myocarditis, autoreactive T cells targeting \nspecific peptides are activated, a process worsened by the \nrelease of self-antigens from dying tumor cells [531]. This \nis known as epitope spreading. Glucocorticoids are the \nmain treatment for non-endocrine irAEs, and hormo-\nnal therapy is used for endocrine disorders. Intravenous \nimmunoglobulins, plasma exchange, and monoclonal \nantibodies such as infliximab are employed for neuro-\nlogical, hematological, and persistent irAEs [22]. For \nICB-induced colitis, fecal microbiota transplantation is \nutilized [532]. All in all, irAEs are life-threatening reac-\ntions that deserve special attention. Thus, it is crucial to \nformulate personalized strategies for patient categoriza-\ntion and potential biomarkers to investigate the dynamics \nand resolution timing of irAEs to identify.\nScarcity of robust predictive biomarkers of response \nand toxicity\nIndividual biomarkers have been utilized to forecast \nresponses to cancer immunotherapy. Both Microsatellite \nInstability-High (MSI-H) and Tumor Mutational Burden \n(TMB) have been associated with enhanced responses to \nICB [533, 534]. Nonetheless, the efficacy of TMB as the \nonly biomarker is restricted, as a low TMB can still elicit \neffective responses, and a high TMB does not assure a \nresponse to ICB [22]. Although immune-related bio-\nmarkers such as PD-L1, interferon signature, and TIL \ndensity have been found to have restrictions when used \nas the only biomarkers, it is important to note that even \nthough there is an association between PD-L1 expression \nand improved outcomes in certain types of tumors, sub-\nstantial responses can still be observed in tumors that do \nnot express PD-L1 [535]. It has been proposed that CAFs, \nmicrobiomes, and exosomes derived from tumors could \nserve as potential biomarkers for tracking the response \nto immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer [536]. Further-\nmore, a study on pancreatic cancer patients who received \nPD-1 inhibitor-based therapies showed that a lower \nneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicted better tumor \nresponse [537]. Collectively, the progression of predictive \nbiomarkers has been obstructed by the intricate inter-\nplay within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. The \nfield must comprehend these interactions and establish \nsuitable assays for successful biomarker development \nand codifying combinatorial biomarker strategies. These \napproaches should be confirmed in upcoming clinical \ntrials.\nLack of integrated regulatory endpoints for cancer \nimmunotherapy\nConventional methodologies for evaluating the efficacy \nof cancer immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab and \nnivolumab, have demonstrated considerable utility [538]. \nThese methodologies encompass metrics such as ORR, \nPFS, and OS, which have been instrumental in assessing \ntherapeutic outcomes. Nevertheless, these conventional \nmetrics exhibit limitations when applied to the evalua-\ntion of cancer immunotherapies. The primary objective \nof cancer immunotherapy is to induce a durable response \nand prolong survival, optimally quantified by examining \nthe ‘tail’ of survival curves. However, the extant meth-\nodologies for this measurement are deficient [539]. In \ncircumstances where an immunotherapy’s impact takes \ntime to manifest and the rate of successful outcomes is \nnot high, conventional benchmarks such as mPFS and \nmedian OS can provide deceptive early indications [473]. \nThis becomes evident in the case of patients with MSI-H \nPDAC who underwent treatment with pembrolizumab. \nDespite a relatively low ORR of 18% and a mPFS of just \n2.1 months, the responses proved to be quite durable, \nwith a median response duration of 13.4 months [540]. \nAll in all, continued collaboration and optimization of \npancreatic cancer immunotherapy endpoints is needed \nto address the aforementioned issues.\nLack of proper preclinical animal models\nPreclinical models are crucial in cancer drug discovery \nfor prioritizing targets and studying various aspects of \ntreatment. These models have contributed to significant \ndiscoveries in cancer treatment and immunotherapy, \nincluding the effects of CTLA-4 and PD-L1/PD-1 block-\nade [539]. Nevertheless, the models commonly utilized \ndo not always accurately represent the immune biology \nof human cancers [541]. This can be attributed to inter-\ntumoral and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, recapitula-\ntion of TME, and serial passaging of tumor cells [542]. \nFor instance, the intricate interplay between tumor and \nstroma, along with the diverse traits of stromal elements, \npresent substantial obstacles in accurately reproducing \nthe pancreatic cancer microenvironment. Furthermore, \nthe weak immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive"}, {"page_number": 46, "text": "Page 46 of 66\nFarhangnia et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:40 \ncharacteristics of PDAC complicate preclinical mode-\nling [542]. A problem with frequently utilized preclinical \nmodels is their dependence on the inoculation of cancer \ncell lines. The tumors that develop following this inser-\ntion often fail to accurately reproduce the immune con-\ntext of the tumor, which plays a crucial role in shaping \nthe immune response in human cancers [543]. Moreover, \ncancer in humans is thought to have evolved over the \nyears, shaping its interaction with the immune response. \nGenetically engineered mouse models, developed by \naltering genes and inducing mutations, best represent \nthis disease [544]. However, these models do not mimic \nthe gradual mutation accumulation seen in human can-\ncers, resulting in stable cancers that do not respond well \nto cancer immunotherapy [539]. Also, a significant obsta-\ncle in current attempts to comprehend the occurrence of \nirAEs is the absence of suitable preclinical animal mod-\nels. There is a pressing need for the generation of ani-\nmal models that accurately mimic irAEs, which would \nfacilitate the detailed study of irAEs associated with pan-\ncreatic cancer immunotherapy [545]. Thus, there is an \nunmet need to further develop pancreatic cancer animal \nmodels with high-throughput techniques for better mim-\nicking the human pancreas cancer features. It can pave \nthe way for a rapid translation of preclinical findings into \nclinical settings.\nConclusion and future directions\nIn summary, the paradigm shift brought about by immu-\nnotherapy is fundamentally altering our understanding of \ncancer treatment. This groundbreaking approach is now \nbeing implemented in clinical settings for a variety of \nsolid cancers. Standard therapies have proven ineffective \nfor patients with PDAC, but immunotherapy has demon-\nstrated encouraging results in preclinical stages. Despite \nthese promising results, immunotherapies still face fun-\ndamental challenges, which may limit their efficacy in \nclinical contexts. It is important to consider that each \ntreatment modality has its advantages and disadvantages \n(Table 10). This article explored a wide range of immu-\nnotherapies, such as OVT, and adoptive cell transfer \ntherapies including TCR-engineered T cells, CAR T-cell \ntherapy, CAR NK cell therapy, and CIK cell therapy. \nAdditionally, ICB, immunomodulators, cancer vaccines, \nand strategies targeting myeloid cells were discussed as \npotential avenues. Furthermore, this article provided the \napplication of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and gut micro-\nbiome in pancreatic cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, strat-\negies for enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy \nand the primary obstacles confronting pancreatic cancer \nimmunotherapy were highlighted.\nThe complex nature and heterogeneous compo-\nsition of cellular elements in the pancreatic tumor \nmicroenvironment are of significant importance. There \nis a complex transition of cell populations as PDAC \nadvances. Employing advanced methods such as single-\ncell sequencing and multi-omics analysis allows us to \ndelve deeper into the immune cell profile in PDAC, pin-\npoint cells with higher precision, and chart the single-\ncell trajectories [546]. This advancement lays a stronger \ngroundwork for developing immunotherapies that target \nthe various elements of the TME.\nAs we progress in developing immunotherapeutic \nstrategies for the treatment and management of PDAC, it \nis crucial to prioritize efforts that enhance patients’ qual-\nity of life. Numerous trials employing immunotherapy in \nPDAC have had disappointing outcomes, primarily due to \nthe immunosuppressive TME. Therefore, it is imperative \nto refine and improve existing immunotherapies to effec-\ntively address this significant challenge. Furthermore, it \nis essential to conduct further research on the efficacy \nof novel immunotherapy targets identified in preclinical \nstudies, thereby validating their potential through human \nclinical trials. Overall, the open-ended research question \nremains unanswered as to why many patients with pan-\ncreatic cancer do not respond to immunotherapies.\nThe identification of novel and appropriate molecu-\nlar targets for targeted immunotherapies is crucial for \nthe success of this immunotherapy in treating pancre-\natic cancer. While CAR-based therapies have achieved \nimpressive clinical responses in targeting cancer anti-\ngens, the efficacy of these therapies in solid cancers has \nbeen disappointing, in part due to antigen escape. Target-\ning heterogeneous pancreatic tumors with immunothera-\npies will require the identification of novel tumor-specific \ntargets. Therefore, identifying novel and appropriate \nmolecular targets for CAR T cell therapy is essential for \nthe development of effective cancer treatments.\nAs our understanding of the complex interplay \nbetween the immune system and pancreatic cancer con-\ntinues to evolve, the field of pancreatic cancer immu-\nnotherapy is positioned at the forefront of cutting-edge \nresearch. These groundbreaking domains of research, \nsuch as machine learning and artificial intelligence [547], \nmutant KRAS peptide-driven vaccines and personalized \nRNA neo-antigen vaccines [401, 548], single-cell multi-\nomics-oriented approaches [546, 549], and CRISPR/Cas-\nbased RNA editing [550], are of utmost importance as \nthey define the active research areas of the future, paving \nthe way for gaining better clinical outcomes. Given the \nrole of artificial intelligence in cancer research, research-\ners used machine learning to analyze complex tumor \nmolecular data from pancreatic cancer patients and \nfound that anti-CD40 therapy reduced T-cell exhaustion \nin the TME. They identified specific T-cell populations \nthat correlated with improved DFS following anti-CD40"}, {"page_number": 47, "text": "Page 47 of 66\nFarhangnia et al.

MEGA also enables the regulation of CAR acti-\nvation and disruption of immunoregulatory metabolic \npathways [550], providing a flexible and powerful tool for \nuse in pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.\nAbbreviations\nAEs\t\n\u0007Adverse events\nAPC\t\n\u0007Antigen-presenting cell\nATRA​\t\n\u0007All-trans retinoic acid\nBreg\t\n\u0007Regulatory B cell\nBsAbs\t\n\u0007Bispecific antibodies\nCAR​\t\n\u0007Chimeric antigen receptor\nCAF\t\n\u0007Cancer-associated fibroblast\ncDCs\t\n\u0007Conventional dendritic cells\nCRS\t\n\u0007Cytokine release syndrome\nCTL\t\n\u0007Cytotoxic T lymphocyte\nCTLA-4\t\n\u0007Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4\nCSF1\t\n\u0007Colony-stimulating factor 1\nCSF-1R\t\n\u0007Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor\nDC\t\n\u0007Dendritic cell\nDFS\t\n\u0007Disease-free survival\nECM\t\n\u0007Extracellular matrix\nEGFR\t\n\u0007Epidermal growth factor receptor\nEMT\t\n\u0007Epithelial-mesenchymal transition\nFAPα\t\n\u0007Fibroblast activation protein alpha\nGM-CSF\t\n\u0007Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor\nICB\t\n\u0007Immune checkpoint blockade\nICI\t\n\u0007Immune checkpoint inhibitor\nIDO\t\n\u0007Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase\nIFN-I\t\n\u0007Type I interferon\nIFN-γ\t\n\u0007Interferon-gamma\nIL\t\n\u0007Interleukin\niPSC\t\n\u0007Induced pluripotent stem cell\nLAG-3\t\n\u0007Lymphocyte-activation gene 3\nmAb\t\n\u0007Monoclonal antibody\nMDSC\t\n\u0007Myeloid-derived suppressor cell\nMHC\t\n\u0007Major histocompatibility complex\nMMP\t\n\u0007Matrix metalloproteinase\nmOS\t\n\u0007Median overall survival\nMSC\t\n\u0007Mesenchymal stem cell\nMSI-H\t\n\u0007Microsatellite Instability-High\nMSLN\t\n\u0007Mesothelin\nNK\t\n\u0007Natural killer\nORR\t\n\u0007Overall response rate\nOS\t\n\u0007Overall survival\nOVT\t\n\u0007Oncolytic virus therapy\nPD-1\t\n\u0007Programmed cell death protein 1\nPDAC\t\n\u0007Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\nPD-L1\t\n\u0007Programmed death-ligand 1\nPFS\t\n\u0007Progression-free survival\nPSC\t\n\u0007Pancreatic stellate cell\nSTING\t\n\u0007Stimulator of interferon genes\nTA-MSCs\t\n\u0007Tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells\nTAM\t\n\u0007Tumor-associated macrophage\nTCR​\t\n\u0007T-cell receptor\nTGF-β\t\n\u0007Transforming growth factor-beta\nTH1\t\n\u0007T helper 1\nTH17\t\n\u0007T helper 17\nTH2\t\n\u0007T helper 2\nTIGIT\t\n\u0007T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains\nTIM-3\t\n\u0007T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3\nTIL\t\n\u0007Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte\nTLR\t\n\u0007Toll-like receptor\nTMB\t\n\u0007Tumor Mutational Burden\nTME\t\n\u0007Tumor microenvironment\nTreg\t\n\u0007Regulatory T cell\nT-VEC\t\n\u0007Talimogene laherparepvec\nVEGF\t\n\u0007Vascular endothelial growth factor\nVISTA\t\n\u0007V-domain Ig-containing suppressor of T-cell activation\nAcknowledgements\nWe apologize to the many authors and colleagues whose works are not cited.\nAuthor contributions\nPF: Conceptualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing; \nHK: writing—review and editing, visualization; HN: Writing—review and edit‑\ning; AAD: Conceptualization, writing—review and editing, and supervision.

As a systemic disease, despite the improvement \nof multi-modality treatment strategies, the prognosis of pancreatic cancer was not improved dramatically. For resect-\nable or borderline resectable patients, the surgical strategy centered on improving R0 resection rate is consensus; \nhowever, the role of neoadjuvant therapy in resectable patients and the optimal neoadjuvant therapy of chemother-\napy with or without radiotherapy in borderline resectable patients were debated. Postoperative adjuvant chemother-\napy of gemcitabine/capecitabine or mFOLFIRINOX is recommended regardless of the margin status. Chemotherapy \nas the first-line treatment strategy for advanced or metastatic patients included FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/nab-\npaclitaxel, or NALIRIFOX regimens whereas 5-FU plus liposomal irinotecan was the only standard of care second-line \ntherapy. Immunotherapy is an innovative therapy although anti-PD-1 antibody is currently the only agent approved \nby for MSI-H, dMMR, or TMB-high solid tumors, which represent a very small subset of pancreatic cancers.

Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \nIntroduction\nPancreatic cancer, specifically, pancreatic ductal adeno-\ncarcinoma (PDAC), has become the third leading cause \nof cancer-related death only behind lung cancer and \ncolorectal cancer in the United States, and is predicted \nto rise to the second by 2030 [1]. In 2023, an estimated \n64,050 new diagnoses and 50,550 deaths from pancreatic \ncancer occurred in the United States [1]. The progno-\nsis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal, 5-year survival \nincreased from 4% in 1997 to 12% in 2018 in pancreatic \ncancer patients of all stages [1]. This small incremental \nimprovement is attributed to the development of multi-\ndisciplinary care and the improvement of multimodality \ntherapies, including surgical resection, radiation, chemo-\ntherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. This arti-\ncle provides a comprehensive review of current treatment \nmodalities for pancreatic cancer, with a particular focus \non recent clinical advancements in the multi-modality \ntreatments of resectable, borderline resectable, local \nadvanced, and metastatic pancreatic cancer. We con-\nducted a comprehensive literature search using databases \nsuch as PubMed, MEDLINE, and clinical trial registries, \nemploying keywords such as “pancreatic cancer,” “treat-\nment,” “neoadjuvant therapy,” and “targeted therapy.” \nStudies were selected based on relevance, recent publica-\ntion date, and the quality of evidence presented. In addi-\ntion, we discuss the latest research and development of \ninnovative therapies for pancreatic cancer.\nMulti‑modality treatments for pancreatic cancer\nThe management of pancreatic cancer requires a com-\nprehensive approach that integrates various treatment \nmodalities, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemother-\napy, and emerging therapies such as immunotherapy and \ntargeted therapy. Given the aggressive nature of pancre-\natic cancer and the complexity of its treatment, a multi-\nmodality strategy is essential to address the disease at \ndifferent stages and to improve patient outcomes. This \nsection will discuss the current standard of care treat-\nments based on resectability status, emphasizing the \nevolving role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies in \nconjunction with surgical intervention.\nSurgical treatment\nPancreatectomy offers the only chance of cure for pan-\ncreatic cancer. Major pancreatectomy such as pancrea-\nticoduodenectomy (also called the Whipple procedure) \nis safe when performed at high-volume centers with \nreported perioperative 30-day mortality rates of less \nthan 3% [2, 3]. Based on the severity of the blood vessel \ninvolvement, localized pancreatic cancers are categorized \ninto resectable pancreatic cancer, borderline resectable \npancreatic cancer (BRPC), and locally advanced unre-\nsectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC) (Table 1) [4].\nSurgery for resectable pancreatic cancer\nAlthough upfront surgical resection followed by adju-\nvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients \nwith resectable pancreatic cancer, the role of neoadju-\nvant therapy in resectable pancreatic cancer remains \ncontroversial. A retrospective study favored neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy (n = 46), which showed superiority over \nupfront resection (n = 113) in resectable pancreatic can-\ncer, with a higher R0 resection rate (83% vs 53%), lower \nrecurrence rate (31% vs 71%), and better overall survival \n(OS) (not reached vs 25.9 months) [5]. Two larger retro-\nspective studies which included 13,674 and 5216 patients \nwith resectable pancreatic cancer, also showed that neo-\nadjuvant therapy with chemoradiotherapy or chemo-\ntherapy followed by surgery may improve OS compared \nto upfront surgery [6, 7]. A meta-analysis which included \n6 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with 469 resectable \npancreatic cancer showed that, compared to upfront sur-\ngery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radio-\ntherapy significantly improved OS, disease-free survival \n(DFS), and R0 resection rate [8]. Similar results were \nfurther corroborated in a more recent meta-analysis \nwhich included 50 studies with resectable pancreatic \ncancer and BRPC [9]. Many prospective clinical trials \nof neoadjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer \nas described below in detail, however, did not provide \nTable 1  NCCN criteria to assess and classify PDAC resectability status\nSMV superior mesenteric vein, PV portal vein, SMA,superior mesenteric artery, CHA common hepatic artery\nResectability status\nResectable\nBorderline resectable\nLocally advanced\nSMV/PV\nNo contact or contact ≤ 180° without vein \ncontour irregularity\nContact > 180°, or ≤ 180° with contour \nirregularity or thrombosis\nUnreconstructable\nSMA\nNo contact\nContact ≤ 180°\nContact > 180°\nCHA\nNo contact\nContact without extension to celiac \ntrunk or hepatic artery bifurcation\nUnreconstructable\nCoeliac trunk\nNo contact\nContact ≤ 180°\nContact > 180°"}, {"page_number": 3, "text": "Page 3 of 59\nWang et al.

Two ongoing phase III RCTs includ-\ning one Alliance trial conducted in the United States \nand the PREOPANC-3 trial conducted in Europe, both \nwith larger sample sizes, are anticipated to provide more \ndefinitive answers to the questions about the role of \nmulti-agent neoadjuvant therapy in resectable pancreatic \ncancer [10, 11]\nSurgery for BRPC and LAPC\nBRPCs portend relatively lower R0 resection rates, and a \nmargin-negative resection for LAPCs is not achievable. \nTherefore, preoperative chemotherapy with or without \nradiation has become a standard approach for patients \nwith BRPC. Evidence supporting a multidisciplinary \nmanagement of BRPC, including chemotherapy, radio-\ntherapy, and surgery, is described below in detail.\nCompared with BRPCs, LAPCs have a lower tumor \nresection rate, even after neoadjuvant therapy. A recent \nmeta-analysis which included 125 studies of either pro-\nspective trials or high-quality retrospective analyses \nfound that the resection rates of BRPCs and LAPCs \nafter neoadjuvant therapy were 60.6% and 22.2%, respec-\ntively; and surgical resection is associated with improved \nsurvival (BRPCs, 32.3 vs 13.9  months; LAPCs, 30.0 vs \n14.6 months) for these localized pancreatic cancers [12]. \nLarge, retrospective studies recently showed that conver-\nsion surgery for LAPCs after FOLFIRINOX chemother-\napy was associated with improved survival [13, 14]. The \nlargest single-center, comparative cohort study of por-\ntal vein resection in pancreatic cancer surgery showed \nconcomitant portal vein resection (n = 694) significantly \nincreased the 90-day mortality rate (6.3% vs 2.6%) com-\npared to that without portal vein resection (n = 1571) \n[15]. Data on arterial resection and reconstruction are \nrelatively few and varied by the resected arteries and the \ntechnical approaches. The reported mortality and mor-\nbidity rates for arterial resection in pancreatectomy were \n5.7% and 41.5%, respectively [16]. The reported mortal-\nity and morbidity rates for celiac axis resection in pan-\ncreatectomy were 1.7% and 39.0%, respectively [17]. \nThus, celiac axis involvement is not considered to be a \nstrict contraindication for surgery in LAPCs. In addition, \ndata (2015–2019) in a retrospective study revealed that \narterial divestment has a significantly reduced mortal-\nity compared to arterial resection (2.3% vs 7.0%) in pan-\ncreatic cancer surgeries [18]. Notably, these aggressive \noperations should be performed only when long-term \nsurvival is expected.\nSurgery for metastatic pancreatic cancer\nMetastatic pancreatic cancer has been traditionally \nregarded as a contraindication for surgical resection. \nHowever, with the use of potent multiagent chemo-\ntherapy, an increasing number of studies investigated \nthe oncologic outcomes of surgical resection in meta-\nstatic or oligometastatic pancreatic cancer. A recent \nmeta-analysis showed that for oligometastatic pancreatic \ncancer to the liver, surgical resection after initial chem-\notherapy achieved increased median OS compared to \nchemotherapy only (23.3–56.0 vs 11.0–16.4 months) [19]. \nA review included 6 studies for lung metastases from \npancreatic cancer and showed that the median OS after \nlung resection ranged from 18.6 to 38.3 months [20]. In \na multicenter phase II study that included 33 patients \nwith peritoneal metastases, 8 patients underwent con-\nversion surgery after paclitaxel/S-1 chemotherapy and \nachieved a median OS of 27.8 months, which was signifi-\ncantly higher than 14.2  months in nonsurgical patients \n[21]. Moreover, in one of the largest retrospective stud-\nies that included 93 metastatic pancreatic cancer follow-\ning the resection of the primary tumor and metastatic \nsites after chemotherapy, 45 patients (48.4%) achieved \ncomplete pathological response in their metastases. This \nstudy also found that only patients with complete patho-\nlogical responses in metastasis could obtain survival ben-\nefits from surgical resection [22]. In spite of these results, \nsurgery for metastatic pancreatic cancer has not been \nwidely accepted due to lack of high-quality clinical trials. \nMore prospective studies are ongoing (NCT04617457, \nNCT03398291) [23, 24].\nMinimally invasive surgery\nMinimally invasive surgery for pancreatic cancer, includ-\ning laparoscopic and robotic approaches, is technically \nchallenging but is gradually being adopted by surgeons \ndue to its potential value in improving the quality of life. \nA multicenter RCT compared the benefit and safety of \nlaparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD, n = 297) \nwith open pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD, n = 297) in \npancreatic or periampullary tumors and showed that \nLPD was associated with a shorter hospital stay (15.0 \nvs 16.0  days) and similar short-term morbidity (29% vs \n23%) and mortality (2% vs 2%) rates [25]. A subsequent \nmeta-analysis which included 3 RCTs reached simi-\nlar conclusions [26]. Moreover, a propensity-matched \nanalysis showed that robotic pancreatoduodenectomy \n(RPD, n = 626) and LPD (n = 2716) for pancreatic cancer \nachieve similar surgical and oncologic outcomes whereas \nRPD compared to LPD showed a lower rate of conversion \nto open (14.7% vs 20.2%) [27]. Accumulated studies have \nsupported the advantages of RPD or LPD although these \nstudies also included patients with benign pancreatic \ndiseases [28]– [30]. Especially, a recent RCT compared \nthe short-term postoperative outcomes of RPD (n = 82) \nwith those of OPD (n = 82) and showed that RPD led to"}, {"page_number": 4, "text": "Page 4 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \na shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (11.0 vs \n13.5  days) and similar rates of perioperative complica-\ntions and postoperative 90-day mortality [31].\nFor distal pancreatectomy, a recent meta-analysis \nincluded 5 matched studies and showed that laparo-\nscopic distal pancreatectomy (n = 1180) is superior to \nopen distal pancreatectomy (n = 1250) including higher \nR0 resection rates (84.3% vs 77.6%) and shorter time to \nadjuvant therapy (45.0 vs 51.0 days) [32]. Most recently, \nan international randomized trial (DIPLOMA) that \nincluded 114 minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy \n(either laparoscopic or robotic) and 110 open distal pan-\ncreatectomy for resectable pancreatic cancers showed \nthe noninferiority of minimally invasive distal pancrea-\ntectomy (R0 resection rate, 73% vs 69%) and compara-\nble postoperative outcomes including lymph node yield \n(22 vs 23), intraperitoneal recurrence rate (41% vs 38%), \nand survival rate (2-year, 46% vs 48%), compared to open \nsurgery [33]. The first benchmark study from 16 interna-\ntional expert centers also demonstrates that, compared to \nlaparoscopic approach, robotic distal pancreatectomy has \na lower conversion rate and fewer overall complications. \nAdditionally, compared to the open approach, robotic \ndistal pancreatectomy is associated with reduced blood \nloss and a shorter hospital stay [34]. Taken together, the \nabove studies support the applicability of minimally inva-\nsive surgery for pancreatic cancer. The 2022 European \nGuidelines for Minimally Invasive Pancreatic Surgery \nmeeting in Brescia published the evidence-based guide-\nlines for minimally invasive pancreatic surgery [35].\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy is one of the most commonly used local \ntherapy approaches. Radiotherapy can be used as a neo-\nadjuvant or adjuvant therapy to improve tumor resec-\ntion rate or to reduce recurrence rate or as a definitive \ntherapy in the localized, unresectable setting to improve \nlocal control. Of note, the exact indications for radiation \nacross disease stages remain controversial. In part, this is \nreflective of variation in outcomes across historical stud-\nies that used techniques which are no longer applicable. \nHowever, recent data using modern techniques have \nshown increasing signals for the benefit that radiation \ntherapy may offer across the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and \ndefinitive settings.\nAdjuvant radiotherapy\nThe role of radiation for adjuvant therapy following com-\nplete macroscopic resection of pancreatic adenocarci-\nnoma has been historically controversial with unclear \nindications for its use. However, evidence supporting \nthe use of adjuvant radiotherapy after pancreatectomy, \nregardless of margin status, is still lacking according to \nprospective, randomized controlled studies. Early data \nfrom randomized studies provided mixed results. In the \n1970s, the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) \nconducted a study in which 43 patients with resected \npancreatic cancer were randomized to either observation \nor 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation [36, 37]. \nThe study used a split-course radiation regimen, where \npatients received two courses of 2 Gy × 10 delivered over \ntwo weeks, with a two-week break in between. A rudi-\nmentary anterior–posterior beam arrangement was uti-\nlized with optional field shaping. 5-FU was administered \nfor three consecutive days at a dose of 500 mg/m2 during \nboth courses of radiation, and continued once weekly as a \nmaintenance regimen for up to two years or until recur-\nrence. The median OS and 2-year OS in the chemora-\ndiation arm were 20 months and 42%, respectively, while \nin the observation arm, these figures were significantly \nlower at 11  months and 15%, respectively. In contrast, \ntwo subsequent European RCTs did not show a benefit to \nadjuvant chemoradiation. In the European Organization \nfor Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 40,891 \nstudy, 218 patients with resected pancreatic cancer \nwere randomized to 5-FU-based chemoradiation versus \nobservation alone [38]. The radiation regimen was simi-\nlar to the split-course used in the GITSG study, although \nno maintenance chemotherapy was offered. Unlike the \nGITSG study, survival analysis yielded no significant dif-\nference between the treatment arms, with median OS \nvalues of 24.5  months and 19.0  months in the chemo-\nradiation and observation arms, respectively (p = 0.21). \nSimilarly, the multicenter randomized trial (ESPAC-1) \nin 2004 observed a negative survival outcome from adju-\nvant chemoradiation (n = 145) compared to no adjuvant \nchemoradiation following surgery (n = 144) (median OS, \n15.9 vs 17.9 months, respectively). In the same study, a \nsignificant survival benefit was observed from adjuvant \nchemotherapy (n = 147) with 5-FU, compared to no adju-\nvant chemotherapy following surgery (n = 142) (median \nOS, 20.1 vs 15.5  months, respectively) [39]. The results \nof this study hindered the further application of adjuvant \nradiotherapy in Europe.\nIn 2010, a randomized phase II study (EORTC-\n40013–22012/FFCD-9203/GERCOR) found that adju-\nvant gemcitabine alone (n = 45) and gemcitabine-based \nchemoradiation (n = 45) after curative resection for pan-\ncreatic cancer (2004–2007) showed comparable median \nDFS (11 vs 12 months) and OS (24 vs 24 months); how-\never, the chemoradiation group had a lower rate of first \nlocal recurrence compared to the chemotherapy alone \ngroup(11% vs 24%) [40]. In 2022, another randomized \ntrial (NCT02461836) of stage II pancreatic cancer with \nnegative margins (2015–2018) demonstrated neither a \nsurvival benefit (median recurrence-free survival, 5.3"}, {"page_number": 5, "text": "Page 5 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \n\t\nvs 9.7  months; median OS, 15.0 vs 28.0  months) nor \nimproved local tumor control with adjuvant gemcitabine \nfollowing stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) (n = 18) \ncompared to adjuvant gemcitabine alone (n = 20) [41].\nDespite the mixed study results in the prospective, \nrandomized setting above, there are still considerable \ndata that argue for consideration of adjuvant radiation, \nparticularly in settings associated with increased local \nrecurrence. A number of patterns of failure studies have \nhighlighted that while systemic failure certainly pre-\ndominates over local failure, local failure rates remain \ngenerally high after complete resection of pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma [42]– [45]. Indeed, even in the PROD-\nIGE24/CCTG PA6 study, 38% of first failures continue \nto have a local component of failure, including 20% with \nlocal failure alone. Moreover, retrospective data from \nhigh-volume institutions also have provided signals \nfor the value of adjuvant radiation. As an example, data \nfrom Johns Hopkins on patterns of failure after pancre-\natic cancer resection from 2000 through 2013 showed \nthat positive margins were the strongest risk factor for \nlocal recurrence, while the administration of the radia-\ntion therapy was the strongest predictor of local control \n[46]. Furthermore, data from Radiation Therapy Oncol-\nogy Group (RTOG) 9704, which was a randomized study \nexploring an adjuvant chemotherapy question in which \nall patients received adjuvant chemoradiation in a “sand-\nwich” schedule, showed that receipt of radiation per pro-\ntocol was associated with improved outcomes, suggesting \nvalue to the delivery of quality radiation therapy [47]. \nEven more, patients on RTOG 9704 who received radia-\ntion per protocol had outcomes that far exceeded simi-\nlarly treated patients who did not have radiation therapy \non CONKO-001 [48, 49].\nTaken together, the role of radiation therapy in the \nadjuvant setting remains undefined. Importantly, RTOG \n0804 was designed to ask this question in a more mod-\nern fashion in which patients with resected pancreatic \ncancer were randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy alone \nversus adjuvant chemotherapy followed by consolidative \nchemoradiation [50]. Radiation therapy in this study was \ndelivered using modern intensity modulated radiation \ntherapy (IMRT). While we await the final publication of \nthese results, early presentation suggests significant ben-\nefits in the node negative patient population [51]. These \nfindings may be due to far higher systemic therapy failure \nrisk in the setting of node positive disease that washes \nout the benefit of local recurrence risk reduction. In fact, \nit likely is that local recurrence is not driven by nodal \npositivity but instead by extra-pancreatic perineural \ninvasion, with many Asian studies supporting this notion \n[52]– [56]. Indeed, the Japanese have intricately char-\nacterized the anatomy of extra-pancreatic neural tracts \nthat are at risk for microscopic disease which may not be \nfully dissected at the time of surgery, which may not be \nfully sterilized by adjuvant chemotherapy, and which may \ntherefore drive local failure. Moreover, data from a phase \nII study demonstrated that nodal involvement was asso-\nciated with systemic failure, while extrapancreatic peri-\nneural involvement was the most important predictor of \nlocal failure [57]. As such, investigators are now actively \nexploring whether designing the radiation fields to target \nthese neural tracts may improve outcomes for pancreatic \ncancer. While such exploration has been primarily in the \nneoadjuvant or definitive settings, it may also apply to the \nadjuvant setting.\nNeoadjuvant radiotherapy\nIt is now widely accepted that the main purposes of neo-\nadjuvant radiotherapy are to enhance the radical resec-\ntion rate and to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Two \nearly single-arm phase II trials demonstrated that neo-\nadjuvant fluorouracil plus cisplatin [58] (n = 41) or gem-\ncitabine [59] (n = 41) with concurrent radiotherapy were \ntolerated and feasible in potentially resectable or non-\nmetastatic pancreatic cancers. However, the evidence on \nthe efficacy of neoadjuvant radiotherapy for pancreatic \ncancer has been inconsistent. A subsequent meta-analy-\nsis found that not only did adjuvant chemoradiotherapy \nhave no significant effect on OS and DFS (17 studies, \nn = 3088) in resectable pancreatic cancer, but there was \nno significant difference between neoadjuvant chemora-\ndiotherapy and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (3 studies, \nn = 189) [60]. Nevertheless, a single-arm phase II clinical \ntrial found that neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX followed by \nindividualized chemoradiation in BRPCs (n = 48) results \nin a high R0 resection rate in resected patients (31/32, \n97%) and prolonged survival (median DFS, 14.7 months; \nmedian OS, 37.7  months), which supported further \ninvestigations [61]. A recent meta-analysis that included \n15 studies (n = 512) also investigated the added value \nof radiotherapy following neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX \nchemotherapy in resectable pancreatic cancer or BRPC \ndemonstrated that radiotherapy following neoadju-\nvant FOLFIRINOX (n = 161) improved the R0 resection \nrate (97.6% vs 88.0%) compared to FOLFIRINOX alone \n(n = 351) although survival benefits (22.4 vs 21.6 months) \nwere not observed [62]. The randomized multicenter \nphase III trial (CONKO-007) investigated induction \nchemotherapy followed by chemoradiation or chemo-\ntherapy alone in 525 nonresectable LAPCs (2013–2021) \n[63]. After induction chemotherapy of FOLFIRINOX \nor gemcitabine, 190 patients with tumor progression or \ntoxicity were excluded; and the remaining 335 were rand-\nomized to chemotherapy (n = 167) or gemcitabine-based \nchemoradiation (50.4  Gy, n = 168). The circumferential"}, {"page_number": 6, "text": "Page 6 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \nresection margin-negative resection rate (19.6% vs 9.0%) \nand complete pathological complete response (6.0% vs \n0%) were significantly higher in the chemoradiotherapy \narm compared to the chemotherapy arm; however, the \n2-year OS rate (34.8% vs 32.5%) and the general R0-resec-\ntion rate (25.0% vs 18.0%) did not differ significantly \nbetween these two arms. A retrospective study of 2019 \npancreatic cancer cases after pancreatoduodenectomy \n(2014–2020) showed that preoperative chemoradiother-\napy but not chemotherapy could reduce the postopera-\ntive pancreatic fistula rate (2.0% vs 4.2%) [64].\nWhile the added value of neoadjuvant radiotherapy \nremains to be established, some studies raised concerns \non adding radiation to chemotherapy. A recent retrospec-\ntive study (2014–2019) that investigated the neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy and radiotherapy outcomes in BRPCs and \nLAPCs (n = 52) found that patients who were candidates \nfor surgery after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy \nof gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or FOLFIRINOX \nwithout radiotherapy had a higher R0 resection (35.0% \nvs 7.6% vs 7.6%) and a prolonged prognosis (median \nOS, 26.2 vs 14.9 vs 7.3 months) than chemotherapy fol-\nlowed by radiation or concurrent chemoradiotherapy \n[65]. Moreover, a two-arms phase II RCT (A021501) \nfound that neoadjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOL-\nFIRINOX) alone (n = 70) was associated with a favorable \nmedian OS (29.8 vs 17.1 months) in patients with BRPC \ncompared to mFOLFIRINOX plus hypofractionated radi-\notherapy (n = 56) [66]. It should be noted that the surger-\nies in this study were conducted in multiple centers with \nheterogenous experience in performing pancreatectomy \nfollowing neoadjuvant radiation. Indeed, the outcomes \nfrom A021501 conflict with data from high volume cent-\ners regarding what should be achieved in the borderline \nresectable setting. As an example, investigators from \nJohns Hopkins recently reported their outcomes in bor-\nderline resectable patients treated with pre-operative \nSBRT over a similar time frame as the A021501 study, \nspecifically 2016–2019 [67]. Over that time, 64 patients \nwith BRPC were treated with pre-operative SBRT, \nwhich translated into 58 (91%) patients being surgically \nexplored, 50 (78%) patients undergoing resection, and \n48 (75%) patients undergoing resection with negative \nmargins. This was dramatically different from what was \nachieved in Alliance, in which of the 40 patients who \nunderwent SBRT, only 28 (70%) were explored, only 19 \n(48%) were resected, and only 14 (35%) were resected \nwith negative margins. These raise serious questions \nregarding the validity of A021501 and its applicability \nto outcomes at high-volume centers. Moreover, they are \nin striking contrast to what was achieved in the PREO-\nPANC-1 study, in which patients with resectable or bor-\nderline resectable pancreatic cancer were randomized to \ngemcitabine-based chemoradiation versus upfront sur-\ngery [68, 69]. Long-term follow-up of this study showed \nthat OS was improved in the pre-operative chemoradia-\ntion arm, with a difference in 5-year OS of 20.5% vs 6.5%. \nMoreover, unplanned subset analysis showed a clear \nbenefit in borderline resectable patients and even a strik-\ning trend towards improvement in resectable patients. \nFurthermore, the improved outcomes were driven by \nimprovements in local control, not systemic failure, high-\nlighting how a decrease in isolated local failure can trans-\nlate into improvements in OS.\nOf note, a critical question is the optimal target volume \ndesign for pancreatic cancer. Historically, the approach \nwas to target gross disease as well as involved vasculature \nin order to improve margin negative resection rates. This \nwas the approach that was taken on A021501, for exam-\nple. However, more recently, there has been interest in \nconsidering elective volume targeting. Indeed, investiga-\ntors from Johns Hopkins demonstrated that while target-\ning of gross disease and involved vasculature led to high \nrates of margin negative resection in the aforementioned \ncohort from 2016 through 2019, local recurrence rates \nremained elevated with 1- and 2-year local progression-\nfree survival (PFS) rates of 70.9% and 54.2%, respectively \n[67]. Importantly, when the locations of the local failures \nwere mapped, they nearly universally mapped the afore-\nmentioned “Triangle volume,” which contains the extra-\npancreatic neural tracts that have been identified to be \nat risk of harboring microscopic residual disease follow-\ning resection, namely the pancreatic head plexus I, the \npancreatic head plexus II, the celiac plexus, the superior \nmesenteric artery plexus, and the common hepatic artery \nplexus [70]. While more extended surgical dissection of \nthe Triangle volume has been advocated for and is being \nexplored, it also stands that the Triangle volume could \nserve as the basis for radiation field design [71]. Indeed, \nfollowing realization that the Triangle volume mediated \nlocal failure, the Johns Hopkins investigators modified \ntheir target volume to include not only gross disease and \ninvolved vasculature but also the full Triangle volume. \nRecent analysis suggests that making this change in field \ndesign has dramatically decreased the local failure rate \n[72]. Furthermore, exploration into the role of dose-\nescalation through technologies such as intraoperative \nradiation is also being explored [73]– [75]. Ultimately, \nmore prospective data is needed with respect to the role \nof modern field design and dose-escalation in the pre-\noperative setting.\nTherefore, the role of radiotherapy as part of neoad-\njuvant therapy for BRPCs and LAPCs is still not con-\nclusive. Several more studies are underway, including a \nrandomized, multicenter phase II trial (NCT05083247) \nassessing the efficacy of adding isotoxic high-dose"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "Page 7 of 59\nWang et al.

The rationale for its use \nis based on the significant morbidity and even mortal-\nity that uncontrolled local progression can drive, which \nhas been characterized in both autopsy series, which \nhave demonstrated the not insignificant rate of patients \ndying from local disease complications, as well as addi-\ntional data highlighting the frequency of hospital admis-\nsions related to complications from local progression \n[78, 79]. However, the prospective, randomized data has \nbeen mixed. A trial comparing gemcitabine plus radio-\ntherapy (n = 34) to gemcitabine alone (n = 37) for LAPCs \ndemonstrated an improved OS (11.1 vs 9.2  months) in \nthe gemcitabine plus radiotherapy arm with acceptable \ntoxicity [80]. However, the phase III RCT LAP07 found \nthat no significant difference in OS (15.2 vs 16.5 months) \nbetween capecitabine-based chemoradiation of 54  Gy \nfollowed by 4  months of maintenance therapy of gem-\ncitabine (n = 109) and gemcitabine alone (n = 112) for \nLAPCs [81]. Nevertheless, chemoradiation decreased \nthe local tumor progression (32% vs 46%). More recently, \nmodern technologies have been developed to deliver \nhigher “ablative” doses to those portions of the tumor \nthat are spatially situated away from dose-limiting gastro-\nintestinal luminal organs. Single-arm retrospective and \nprospective studies have demonstrated further improve-\nments in local control rates with such dose-escalated \nradiation, although its benefit compared to chemother-\napy alone in the prospective setting still needs to be dem-\nonstrated [82]– [90].\nNotably, while LAPC used to be synonymous with \nunresectable, this is clearly not the case anymore, as \nseries from high-volume institutions have shown the \nability to achieve margin negative resection in a high pro-\nportion of patients [13, 91]. It should be noted that the \nvast majority of patients in these series were treated with \npre-operative radiation such that the ability to achieve \nsuch high margin negative rates in the LAPC setting \nwith chemotherapy alone is unclear. The value that pre-\noperative radiation may have in LAPC patients under-\ngoing exploration is being explored on the CONKO-007 \nstudy [63]. While we await publication of results and \nlonger-term follow-up, initial presentation has sug-\ngested improvement in margin negative resection rate \nwith pre-operative radiation, with some signal that long \nterm 5-year OS may also be higher in the chemoradiation \narm (10.1% vs 3.8%, not formally statistically compared), \nwhich would mirror results from the PREOPANC-1 \nstudy referenced above. Ultimately, more data is needed \nin this regard.\nChemotherapy\nFirst‑line chemotherapy for advanced and metastatic \npancreatic cancer\nFor patients with advanced or metastatic disease, chemo-\ntherapy is the only systemic therapy that offers a mean-\ningful benefit. Before the registration of gemcitabine, \n5-FU was the only chemotherapeutic option for treating \npancreatic cancer for two decades. Then, gemcitabine \nhas been approved as a first-line treatment for pancre-\natic cancer since 1997 (Fig. 1), when a randomized trial \nshowed that gemcitabine (n = 63) is more effective by \nhaving a higher clinical response (23.8% vs 4.8%) and pro-\nviding a moderately better survival advantage (median \nOS, 5.65 vs 4.41 months) than 5-FU (n = 63) in advanced \npancreatic cancer [92]. Subsequently, gemcitabine has \nbeen investigated in combination with other agents or \ncompared with other combination chemotherapy; how-\never, most of these studies did not achieve their primary \nendpoint, including 5-FU [93], irinotecan [94], cisplatin \n[95, 96], oxaliplatin [97], capecitabine [98]– [100], FOL-\nFIRI.3 (irinotecan, leucovorin and 5-FU) [101], tipifarnib \n[102], cetuximab [103], bevacizumab [104], and axitinib \n[105]. Nevertheless, in a phase III study, gemcitabine plus \nerlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \ntyrosine kinase inhibitor, emerged as a regimen confer-\nring a statistically significant survival advantage over \ngemcitabine plus placebo (Fig.  1) [106], however, the \nprolongation of median OS by 10 days is not considered \nclinically meaningful.\nCombination chemotherapy for advanced and meta-\nstatic pancreatic cancer has made significant progress \nin the last two decades (Table 2). In 2003, Conroy and \ncolleagues reported the results of an open-label phase \nI study demonstrating the safety and feasibility of a \nnovel multi-agent chemotherapy regimen, the combi-\nnation of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and leucovorin/5-FU, \ndesignated FOLFIRINOX, for treating metastatic solid \ntumors [107]. In 2011, the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 \ntrial subsequently showed that FOLFIRINOX was asso-\nciated with a better median OS (11.1 vs 6.8  months) \nand PFS (6.4 vs 3.3 months) in patients with metastatic \npancreatic cancer, but increased toxicity including \ngrade 3–4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombo-\ncytopenia, diarrhea, and sensory neuropathy, compared \nto gemcitabine (Fig.  1) [108]. However, no treatment-\nrelated deaths occurred in the FOLFIRINOX arm while"}, {"page_number": 8, "text": "Page 8 of 59\nWang et al.

This trial thus estab-\nlished FOLFIRINOX as a new standard for advanced \nor metastatic pancreatic cancer. Indeed, a dedicated \nquality of life analysis subsequently showed that FOL-\nFIRINOX maintained or conferred even an improve-\nment of quality of life compared to gemcitabine alone \nin patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer [109]. \nSubsequently, a multicenter phase II study accessed \nmFOLFIRINOX in locally advanced (n = 31) and met-\nastatic (n = 44) pancreatic cancer and concluded that \nmFOLFIRINOX offers equivalent efficacy, but lower \ngrade 3/4 adverse events including neutropenia (12.2% \nvs 45.7%), vomiting (2.7% vs 14.5%) and fatigue (12.2% \nvs 23.6%), compared to the original FOLFIRINOX in \nthe PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 study [110]. Another \nrandomized phase II trial (PANOPTIMOX-PRODIGE \n35) evaluated an oxaliplatin stop-and-go strategy and a \n5-FU maintenance strategy [111]. In this trial, patients \nwere assigned to receive either 6  months of FOL-\nFIRINOX (Arm A), 4 months of FOLFIRINOX followed \nby leucovorin plus 5-FU maintenance treatment (Arm \nB), or alternate between gemcitabine and FOLFIRI (the \ncombination of 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan) every \n2  months as maintenance therapy (Arm C). Although \nthis study did not reach the primary endpoint, median \nsurvival without deterioration in quality-of-life scores \nwas the highest in Arm B with a maintenance strategy \n(11.4  months) compared to Arms A and C (7.2 and \n7.5 months, respectively).\nAlbumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a nano-\nparticle form of paclitaxel. In 2013, the large, open-\nlabel, international, randomized, phase III MPACT trial \nenrolled 861 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer \nand no prior chemotherapy and randomized them to \nreceive gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine \nalone (Fig.  1)  [112]. Improved survival was observed \nin the gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel arm compared \nto gemcitabine alone (median OS, 8.5 vs 6.7  months; \nmedian DFS, 5.5 vs 3.7 months; response rate, 23% vs 7%, \nrespectively). Updated results at the 42-month landmark \nrevealed that, while no patients remained alive in the \ngemcitabine alone arm, a small yet impactful proportion \nFig. 1  Timeline for pancreatic cancer treatment progression.

Over the past decade, significant advancements have \nbeen made in chemotherapy options for pancreatic cancer, including the introduction of FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, \nand fluorouracil), gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (Gem + nab-P), S-1, liposomal irinotecan (Nal-IRI), gemcitabine plus capecitabine (Gem + Cap), \nmodified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX), and NALIRIFOX (liposomal irinotecan, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil). Immunotherapy \nhas also made strides, with pembrolizumab, which targets the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway, showing improved outcomes in MSI-H/\ndMMR and TMB-H solid tumors. Erlotinib, an EGFR-targeting agent, showed slight improvement when combined with Gem compared to Gem \nalone. Recent clinical investigations have highlighted the efficacy of PARP inhibitors such as olaparib in significantly prolonging survival for patients \nwith germline BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer, leading to FDA approval for maintenance treatment in cases with non-progressing disease \nfollowing at least 16 weeks of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

These results led the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) to approve liposomal irinotecan \nfor the first-line treatment of pancreatic cancer in 2024.\nBy far, no formal comparison was made between FOL-\nFIRINOX and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. PASS-01 is \na multicenter, randomized phase II trial evaluating the \nbenefit of first-line mFOLFIRINOX vs gemcitabine/\nnab-paclitaxel in untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer \npatients whose baseline tumor biopsies were obtained \nfor whole genome/transcriptional sequencing and for \nestablishing patient-derived organoids [117]. Prelimi-\nnary analysis showed an over 80% success rate in obtain-\ning whole genomes and a 50% success rate in establishing \npatient-derived organoids for drug sensitivity tests. Inter-\nestingly, median PFS was 5.1  months in the gemcit-\nabine/nab-paclitaxel arm (n = 69) and 4.0 months in the \nmFOLFIRINOX arm (n = 71) although PFS in both arms \nappears to be poorer than historical controls.\nSeveral studies have investigated the efficacy of gem-\ncitabine/nab-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX in LAPCs. In \na phase II study (LAPACT) investigating gemcitabine/\nnab-paclitaxel for treating 106 patients, 62 patients (58%) \ncompleted induction therapy and 17 (16%) underwent \nsurgery (7 had R0 resection, 9 had R1), with a median \ntime to treatment failure of 9.0  months [118]. Another \nrandomized phase II study (NEOLAP-AIO-PAK-0113) \nof 64 patients yielded a higher surgical conversion rate \nand median OS with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (n = 64) \nat 35.9% and 18.5 months, respectively and with gemcit-\nabine/nab-paclitaxel followed by FOLFIRINOX (n = 66) \nat 43.9% and 20.7  months, respectively [119]. A phase \nIII study (PRODIGE 29/NEOPAN)  also showed that \nFOLFIRINOX yielded a significantly longer PFS (9.8 \nvs 7.5  months) compared to gemcitabine with similar \ngrade ≥ 3 adverse events (41% vs 38%) [120]. These find-\nings thus support using FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/\nnab-paclitaxel in the induction chemotherapy for LAPCs.\nSecond‑line chemotherapy for advanced and metastatic \npancreatic cancer\nSecond-line regimens after gemcitabine-based chem-\notherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer have been \nstudied in several trials (Table 2). The CONKO-003 ran-\ndomized phase III trial demonstrated that second-line \ntreatment with oxaliplatin plus folinic acid and fluoro-\nuracil (OFF) significantly extended survival compared to \nfolinic acid and fluorouracil (FF) alone (median OS, 5.9 \nvs 3.3  months) [121]. However, results from the phase \nIII PANCREOX trial showed that the addition of oxali-\nplatin to 5-FU/leucovorin (mFOLFOX6) as second-line \ntreatment may be detrimental compared to 5-FU/leuco-\nvorin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who \nprogressed on gemcitabine-based treatment, includ-\ning worse median OS (6.1 vs 9.9 months) and increased \ngrade 3/4 adverse events (63% vs 11%) [122]. Later, the \nrandomized phase III trial NAPOLI-1 supported liposo-\nmal irinotecan with 5-FU/leucovorin (5-FU/liposomal \nirinotecan) as a standard of care second-line therapy in \nmetastatic pancreatic cancer after previous gemcitabine-\nbased therapy by showing a significantly longer median \nOS with 5-FU/liposomal irinotecan than that with 5-FU/\nleucovorin (6.1 vs 4.2 months) (Fig. 1) [123]. 5-FU/lipo-\nsomal irinotecan became the only standard of care sec-\nond-line therapy after gemcitabine-based therapy for \nmetastatic pancreatic cancer. Nevertheless, it would be \nappropriate to use mFOLFIRINOX as second-line ther-\napy for selected patients with a good performance status \nafter gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.\nAs a second-line systemic treatment after progression \nwith FOLFIRINOX has not been standardized, the cur-\nrent clinical practice is to switch to gemcitabine/nab-\npaclitaxel or gemcitabine-based regimen. On another \nhand, FOLFIRINOX is also a choice of second-line treat-\nment if the patient progresses through a gemcitabine-\nbased first-line treatment. Multiple retrospective studies \nsupported the use of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel as a sec-\nond-line regimen for patients who cannot tolerate or pro-\ngress with FOLFIRINOX [124]– [126].\nAdjuvant chemotherapy\nAdjuvant systemic treatment is universally recom-\nmended for all eligible patients undergoing resection \nfor PDAC. Gemcitabine monotherapy has been a cor-\nnerstone of adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic \ncancer for decades. However, compelling evidence sup-\nporting gemcitabine as the standard of care for adjuvant \ntreatment was not established until 2007 by the rand-\nomized controlled trial CONKO-001 (Table  3) [127]. \nPreliminary results of this trial showed that postopera-\ntive adjuvant gemcitabine therapy significantly delayed \nthe development of recurrent disease after complete \nresection of pancreatic cancer compared to observation \nalone (median DFS, 13.4 vs 6.9 months; DFS at 5-year, \n16.5% vs 5.5%). Long-term outcomes from this trial also \nshowed improvements in 5-year OS (20.7% vs 10.4%) \nand 10-year OS (12.2% vs 7.7%) [128]. In 2010, the RCT \nESPAC-3 investigated adjuvant chemotherapy with \n5-FU plus folinic acid regimen (n = 551) versus gemcit-\nabine (n = 537) following pancreatic cancer resection. \nThe study reported no statistically significant difference \nbetween the two arms in terms of median OS (23.0 vs \n23.6 months), PFS (14.1 vs 14.3 months), or quality-of-\nlife outcomes [129]. In 2016, a phase III, randomized,"}, {"page_number": 11, "text": "Page 11 of 59\nWang et al.

Consequently, S-1 \nbecame the standard of care for adjuvant chemotherapy \nin East Asia. However, S-1 has not been widely adopted \nin North America and Europe, where gemcitabine \nremains the standard of care. This is primarily due to \nthe lower maximum tolerated dose of S-1 in Caucasians \ncompared to East Asians, largely because of increased \ngastrointestinal toxicity, particularly diarrhea [131]. As \na result, it has been difficult to replicate the favorable \noutcomes seen in Asian clinical trials in Western popu-\nlations, leading to the continued preference for gemcit-\nabine in these regions.\nIn 2017, the multicenter, randomized phase III trial \nESPAC-4 compared adjuvant therapy with gemcitabine \nand capecitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy. The \ntrial demonstrated that the median OS in the gemcit-\nabine plus capecitabine arm (n = 364) was significantly \nimproved (28.0 vs 25.5  months) compared to the gem-\ncitabine monotherapy arm (n = 366) [132]. This finding \nsupports the use of gemcitabine in combination with \ncapecitabine as a standard-of-care adjuvant therapy for \npancreatic cancer.\nIn contrast, the CONKO-005 trial, which investi-\ngated the addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine, did not \nshow any benefit from the addition of erlotinib as an \nadjuvant therapy [133]. The phase II/III RTOG 0848 \ntrial (NCT01013649) demonstrated that while adding \nadjuvant radiation to chemotherapy did not improve \nOS across the entire study population, it did improve \nDFS, with both OS and DFS showing enhancement in \nthe node-negative subgroup patients [51].

Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy as a part of multidisciplinary \nmanagement  Pancreatic cancer frequently presents with \nmicrometastatic disease even at early stages, underscor-\ning the necessity of a systemic treatment paradigm [136]. \nMoreover, approximately one-third of patients are unable \nto complete planned adjuvant chemotherapy regimens \nfollowing pancreatic resection due to postoperative com-\nplications [137]. Neoadjuvant therapy aims to optimize \npatient tolerance and the delivery of full-dose chemother-\napy regimens, mitigating the risk of inadequate manage-\nment of subclinical metastatic deposits that often drive \nmortality. Neoadjuvant therapy also provides opportuni-\nties to evaluate in vivo tumor responses to chemothera-\npeutics and potentially identify patients most likely to \nbenefit from surgical resection. Additionally, neoadju-\nvant therapy may increase the rate of R0 margin-negative \nresections by downsizing primary and nodal tumor bur-\ndens before surgery. Recent clinical trials investigating \nneoadjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer and \nBRPC are summarized in Table 4.\nNeoadjuvant therapy for  resectable pancreatic can‑\ncer  One of the primary objectives of neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer is to \nenhance the likelihood that patients will benefit from a \nmulti-modal treatment approach that combines systemic \ntherapy with surgical intervention. A propensity-matched \nobservational analysis of over 15,000 resected patients \ndemonstrated significantly improved OS among those \nreceiving neoadjuvant therapy compared to those with-\nout neoadjuvant therapy (median OS, 26 vs 21 months) \n[138]. Preliminary data from the randomized phase II/III \nPACT-15 trial showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy \nwith the PEXG regimen (cisplatin, epirubicin, capecit-\nabine, and gemcitabine) improved the R0 resection rate \nand OS (63%, 38.2 months) compared with adjuvant gem-\ncitabine (27%, 20.4  months) and adjuvant PEXG (37%, \n26.4  months) for resectable pancreatic cancer [139]. \nHowever, with the change in standard of care for adjuvant \ntherapy, the phase III component of PACT-15 was discon-\ntinued, leaving the trial inconclusive. Another phase II/\nIII study (Prep-02/JSAP-05) randomized predominantly \nresectable cases to receive neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus \nS-1 followed by surgery or undergo upfront surgery fol-\nlowed by six months of adjuvant S-1 [140]. Although the \nneoadjuvant arm demonstrated improved median OS \n(36.7 vs 26.6 months), the difference may have been influ-\nenced by the unequal chemotherapy regimens between \narms. While essentially all the patients in the neoadjuvant \narm underwent surgical resection, the trial did not repli-\ncate the results of the pivotal phase III JASPAC 01 trial, \nwhich reported a median OS of 46.5 months with adju-\nvant S-1 therapy [130].\nConversely, several RCTs have not supported neoad-\njuvant therapy. A randomized phase II trial comparing \nneoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy with gemcitabine/\ncisplatin to upfront surgery was terminated early due \nto slow patient recruitment [141]. With only 66 analyz-\nable patients, no significant differences were observed \nbetween the two arms in terms of R0 resection rates (52% \nvs 48%), pathologic node negativity rates (39% vs 30%), or \nOS (25.0 vs 18.9 months). The NEONAX trial compared \nperioperative gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel to adjuvant \ngemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel [142]. The primary end-\npoint was to achieve an 18-month DFS rate of 55%, based \non a 38% 18-month DFS seen with gemcitabine alone \nin the CONKO-001 trial; however, neither arm met this \nendpoint, with rates of 33.3% in the perioperative arm \nand 41.4% in the adjuvant arm [143].\nSeveral phase II studies have evaluated the feasibility \nand efficacy of neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX compared \nto upfront surgery. The prospective, multicenter, non-\ncomparative phase II PANACHE01-PRODIGE48 trial \nrandomly assigned 146 patients to neoadjuvant mFOL-\nFIRINOX, FOLFOX or upfront surgery arms [144]. The \nFOLFOX arm was discontinued for lack of efficacy, and \nthe mFOLFIRINOX arm showed no significant improve-\nment in the 1-year OS rate (84.1% vs 80.8%) compared \nto upfront surgery. The recent multicenter, randomized \nphase II NORPACT-1 trial included 77 patients receiv-\ning neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX and 63 patients undergo-\ning upfront surgery for resectable pancreatic head cancer \n[145]. Surprisingly, the median OS in the neoadjuvant \nFOLFIRINOX arm was 13.4 months shorter than that in \nthe adjuvant FOLFIRINOX arm (25.1 vs 38.5  months), \nas well as lower resection rate (82% vs 89%). However, \nthis study had several limitations. The phase II design \nlimited the conclusiveness of the results. The use of full-\ndose neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX instead of a modified \nregimen may have contributed to increased toxicity and \nreduced compliance. Additionally, histological confir-\nmation of PDAC was not mandatory before randomi-\nzation, leading to the inclusion of 11 patients (8%) with \nnon-PDAC diagnoses, which may have influenced the \noutcomes although these conditions would be antici-\npated to have a more favorable outcome. The phase II \nSWOG S1505 trial evaluated the efficacy of neoadju-\nvant mFOLFIRINOX versus nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine \nfor resectable patients. Median OS was 22.4  months \nfor mFOLFIRINOX and 23.6  months for gemcitabine/\nnab-paclitaxel, failing to show a clinically meaningful \nimprovement over upfront surgery [146]. The multi-\ncenter, randomized phase III PREOPANC-2 trial enrolled \npatients with both BRPC and resectable pancreatic can-\ncer patients across 19 Dutch centers [147].

This trial found no differences \nin OS (21.9 vs 21.3  months) or resection rate (77% vs \n75%) between the two arms. However, the gemcitabine \nchemoradiotherapy group achieved significantly higher \nlymph node-negative (N0) status post-operatively com-\npared to the FOLFIRINOX group (58% vs 47%) [147]. \nAs described above, the field is hoping that the Alliance \nA021806 trial and PREOPANC-3 trial which are evaluat-\ning the efficacy of perioperative mFOLFIRINOX versus \nadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX will provide a more defini-\ntive answer on the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in \nresectable pancreatic cancer [10, 11].\nNotably, given the promising role of NALIRIFOX \nin systemic treatment, this regimen is currently being \nevaluated in the neoadjuvant setting. For example, in \nthe phase II nITRO trial, NALIRIFOX demonstrated \npromising outcomes with an R0 resection rate of 65.3% \namong 76 resected patients, and a median DFS and OS \nof 31.3 and 44.9 months, respectively [148]. Similarly, in \nthe phase II NEO-Nal-IRI trial, NALIRIFOX as neoad-\njuvant therapy achieved an R0 resection rate of 89% in \n29 patients (14 resectable and 15 borderline resectable) \n[149]. While these preliminary results suggest potential \nefficacy of NALIRIFOX as a neoadjuvant therapy, further \nstudies are needed to confirm its benefits. Moreover, the \ndevelopment of a biomarker assay to guide individual-\nized selection of neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens is \ncrucial. Such an assay could also be applicable for select-\ning adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. The key challenge \nremains in identifying biomarkers that can accurately \npredict which patients are most likely to benefit from \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nThe indiscriminate administration of neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy to all surgically resectable pancreatic can-\ncer patients without appropriate selection could poten-\ntially cause unintended harm, as tumor progression or \nchemotherapy toxicity may render patients ineligible \nfor surgery, which remains the only curative treatment \noption. Without a biomarker for patient selection, cur-\nrent considerations include selecting individuals with \nhigh-risk features associated with an increased likelihood \nof local or distant recurrence post-resection, such as ele-\nvated preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9) \nlevels, radiological evidence of suspicious lymphadenop-\nathy or metastases, or the presence of circulating tumor \ncells or cell-free DNA. Further validation is needed to \ndetermine whether using these criteria to select patients \nfor neoadjuvant therapy would enhance its benefits.\nNeoadjuvant therapy for  BRPC  There is growing con-\nsensus on the benefits of neoadjuvant therapy for BRPC. \nA key advantage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in BRPC \nis the potential increase in the likelihood of achiev-\ning R0 resection status. Single-arm studies, such as the \nAlliance A021101 trial, have provided preliminary evi-\ndence supporting the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant \ntherapy with mFOLFIRINOX followed by capecitabine-\nbased chemoradiation for BRPCs. Of the 15 participants \nwho completed the preoperative protocols (68%), all but \none achieved negative margins on pancreatectomy. The \nmedian OS for the full cohort reached 21.7 months [150]. \nThe phase III PREOPANC-1 trial randomized 246 patients \nwith resectable or borderline resectable disease to neoad-\njuvant chemoradiation or upfront surgery (approximately \n50% in each group). The neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy \nregimen consisted of three cycles of gemcitabine com-\nbined with 36 Gy radiotherapy in 15 fractions during the \nsecond cycle, followed by four cycles of adjuvant gem-\ncitabine. In contrast, patients in the upfront surgery arm \nreceived six cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine. Neoadjuvant \ntherapy improved the R0 resection rate (72% vs 43%) and \ndecreased tumor size (25 vs 33 mm) as well as the percent-\nage of node-positive status (35% vs 82%), perineural inva-\nsion (45% vs 85%), and vascular invasion (36% vs 65%). \nHowever, the median OS was only slightly prolonged by \n1.4 months, from 14.3 to 15.7 months [69]. The ESPAC-5 \nphase II study randomized 90 BRPCs to short-course neo-\nadjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy, capecitabine-based \nchemoradiation or upfront surgery alone and showed that \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy with either FOLFIRINOX or \ngemcitabine/capecitabine improved 1-year OS compared \nto upfront surgery (84% and 78%, respectively vs 39%) \nwhereas neoadjuvant 50.4 Gy capecitabine-based chem-\noradiation did not (60% vs 39%), thus supporting short-\ncourse neoadjuvant chemotherapy for BRPCs. Although \nR0 resection rates did not statistically differ between \narms, all arms had low R0 resection rates likely due to \nthe differences among centers in the definition of BRPCs \nresulting in the inclusion of LAPCs [151].\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy has achieved significant clinical break-\nthroughs in various solid tumors, such as non-small \ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma [152, 153]. \nTargeting immune checkpoint molecules, such as pro-\ngrammed death-1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 \n(PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein \n4 (CTLA-4), leads to the reinvigoration of the anti-tumor \nimmune response in cancers, resulting in improved clini-\ncal outcomes [154]– [156]. Unfortunately, pancreatic \ncancer responds poorly to immunotherapy, particularly \nimmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), due to its poor \nimmunogenic properties, low number of neoantigens, \nand \nimmunosuppressive \ntumor \nmicroenvironment"}, {"page_number": 17, "text": "Page 17 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \n\t\n(TME) [157, 158]. Single-agent ICIs have thus far proven \nclinically ineffective, but multi-modal therapies target-\ning mechanisms of ICI resistance still hold promise, as \ndescribed in detail below. Strategies seeking to combine \nchemotherapy with ICIs have not proven effective in pan-\ncreatic cancer [159, 160].\nNotably, a rare subtype of pancreatic cancer, account-\ning for approximately 0–1.3% of all pancreatic cancers, is \ncharacterized by microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) \nor mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), which confers \nhigh immunogenicity [161]. In 2017, pembrolizumab was \napproved for the treatment of patients with unresect-\nable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR solid tumors, including \npancreatic cancer, that had progressed on prior treat-\nment with no satisfactory alternative treatment options \n(Fig. 1) [162]. In the initial study demonstrating the ben-\nefits of pembrolizumab in dMMR solid tumors, among \n8 patients with pancreatic cancer, 5 (62.5%) achieved \ncomplete or partial responses [163]. In the subsequent \nphase II KEYNOTE-158 study of pembrolizumab in \npatients with previously treated, advanced cancer, which \nincluded 233 MSI-H/dMMR non-colorectal patients \nwith 27 tumor types, the objective response rate (ORR) \nwas 34.3%, and the median DFS and OS were 4.1 and \n23.5  months, respectively [164]. Among 22 patients \nwith pancreatic cancer in this study, the ORR was 18.2%, \nand the median PFS and OS were 2.1 and 4.0  months, \nrespectively.\nAnother rare subtype of MMR-proficient (MMR-\np) pancreatic cancer is characterized by a high tumor \nmutation burden (TMB). In 2020, pembrolizumab was \napproved for treating patients with TMB-high (≥ 10 \nmutations/megabase) metastatic or unresectable solid \ntumors (Fig.  1). This approval was based on the KEY-\nNOTE-158 study descripted above, in which the TMB-\nhigh group (n = 102) achieved significantly higher ORR \n(29% vs 6%) compared to the TMB-low group (n = 688) \n[165]. Additionally, another study compared clinical and \ngenomic data from 1,662 patients with advanced cancer \nwho were treated with ICIs to 5,371 patients without ICI \ntreatments, finding that TMB-high was associated with \nimproved survival in patients receiving ICI treatment \nacross a wide variety of cancer types [166]. Therefore, for \npancreatic cancer with MSI-H, dMMR, or TMB-high, \nICIs are a recommended, standard-of-care treatment \noption [167].\nTargeted therapy\nOver the past decade, the development of molecular tar-\ngeted therapeutics for pancreatic cancer has undergone a \nsignificant transformation. Advances in next-generation \nsequencing technology and bioinformatics have facili-\ntated the discovery of driver mutations and dysregulated \npathways in pancreatic cancer, leading to the identifi-\ncation of novel therapeutic targets [168, 169]. Conse-\nquently, innovative targeted therapies, derived from \ngenomic data, hold promise for enhancing survival rates \nand quality of life for pancreatic cancer patients. Targeted \ntherapy underscores the association between tumor char-\nacteristics and individualized treatment responses, with \nbiomarkers and genomic mutations serving as potential \ntherapeutic targets or prognostic indicators based on \ntheir expression. Broadly, targeted therapies encompass \nthree principal strategies: inhibiting the aberrant activa-\ntion of oncogenes, interfering with the inactivation of \ntumor suppressor genes, and exploiting biological func-\ntional defects in specific genes [170]. Oncogenic muta-\ntions in the KRAS gene and loss of the tumor suppressor \ngenes like TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 are frequently \nobserved in pancreatic cancer, and were deemed as \ndriver mutations [171]. Besides, homologous recombi-\nnation deficiency (HRD) in pancreatic cancer, loss of a \ncritical DNA repair pathway, will increase sensitivity to \ncertain DNA damaging agents, including platinum-based \nchemotherapy and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) \npolymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Targeted therapies for \npancreatic cancer have made new progress mainly in \nKRAS and PARP inhibitors.\nEGFR signaling is required for KRAS oncogene-driven \nPDAC [172]. In 2005, the FDA approved gemcitabine in \ncombination with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib as the first-\nline treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, or meta-\nstatic PDAC, marking erlotinib as the first targeted drug \napproved for pancreatic cancer (Fig. 1). This approval was \nbased on a phase III trial that demonstrated a statistically \nsignificant, though not clinically meaningful, improve-\nment in median OS with the combination of erlotinib \nand gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine alone (6.2 vs \n5.9  months) [106]. Consequently, erlotinib was eventu-\nally abandoned in clinical practice for pancreatic cancer \ntreatment.\nCells employ multiple DNA repair mechanisms, \nincluding base excision, nucleotide excision, mismatch \nrepair, homologous recombination, and non-homologous \nend joining, to maintain genomic integrity in response to \nDNA damage [173]. Mutations in these DNA repair path-\nways can lead to genomic instability and an increased \nrisk of tumorigenesis. In PDAC, approximately 19% of \npatients had HRD, that is germline or somatic homolo-\ngous recombination gene mutations such as BRCA1, \nBRCA2, PALB2, ATM, BAP1 [174]. A meta-analysis \ninvolving 21,842 PDAC patients revealed that whole \ngenome or whole exome sequencing can detect a higher \nproportion of patients with HRD (24–44%) compared to \ngene-level hotspot/targeted next-generation sequenc-\ning (14.5–16.5%). Specific prevalence rates for germline"}, {"page_number": 18, "text": "Page 18 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \nand somatic HRD mutations in pancreatic cancer include \nBRCA1: 0.9%, BRCA2: 3.5%, PALB2: 0.2%, ATM: 2.2%, \nand CHEK2: 0.3% [175]. Detection of HRD pathway \ndeficiencies, often referred to as “BRCAness”, is crucial \nfor PDAC treatment, as patients with these deficien-\ncies not only respond to platinum-based therapies like \ncisplatin but also benefit from PARP inhibitors such as \nOlaparib [176]. These agents act by interfering with DNA \nrepair mechanisms, causing DNA damage, and subse-\nquently inducing tumor apoptosis [177, 178]. A rand-\nomized phase II trial assessed cisplatin-gemcitabine with \nand without the PARP inhibitor veliparib in 50 patients \nwith advanced germline BRCA-mutated and PALB2-\nmutated pancreatic cancer, showing ORRs of 74.1% and \n65.2% (P = 0.55), respectively [179]. Retrospective analy-\nses have shown higher ORR in germline BRCA-mutated \nand BRCA2-mutated PDAC patients treated with FOL-\nFIRINOX (71.4% vs 13.9%; P = 0.004) and in patients \nwith germline BRCA-mutated and PALB2-mutated \nadvanced pancreatic cancer treated with platinum-based \ntherapies (58% vs 21%; P = 0.002)  [180, 181]. Another \nretrospective study also showed BRCA-mutated BRPCs \nshowed a significantly higher rate of complete pathologic \nresponse (44.4% vs 10%, P = 0.009) after neoadjuvant \nFOLFIRINOX [182]. PARP inhibitors are being explored \nin both maintenance and adjuvant settings for pancre-\natic cancer patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations \n[183]. Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, has demonstrated effi-\ncacy in tumors with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 muta-\ntions. In 2019, a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial \n(POLO) reported on the primary endpoint of PFS. The \ntrial showed that among patients with germline BRCA \nmutation and metastatic pancreatic cancer who had not \nprogressed during platinum-based chemotherapy, main-\ntenance olaparib (n = 92) achieved a longer PFS (7.4 vs \n3.8  months) compared with placebo (n = 62) [184]. The \nORR was 23% in the olaparib group and 12% in the pla-\ncebo group. Based on these results, the FDA approved \nolaparib for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated \nmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the end of 2019 \n(Fig.  1). Although no statistically significant OS benefit \nwas observed between the olaparib and placebo groups \n(19.0 vs 19.2  months), the Kaplan–Meier OS curves \nbegan to separate at approximately 24  months, with \nsurvival rates of 33.9% vs 17.8% at the greatest point of \nseparation (36 months), further supporting the clinically \nmeaningful benefits of maintenance olaparib [185].\nIn addition to the HRD pathway, gene fusions can \nalso drive tumorigenesis and serve as potential thera-\npeutic targets, such as neurotrophic tyrosine receptor \nkinase (NTRK) and neuregulin 1 (NRG1) [186]. These \ngene fusions typically detected in KRAS wild-type pan-\ncreatic cancers. The frequencies of NTRK and NRG1 \nfusions are 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively [187]. In 2018, \nthe FDA approved the use of the highly selective TRK \ninhibitor larotrectinib for adults and children with solid \ntumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion without a known \nacquired resistance mutation (Fig. 1). This approval was \nbased on three multicenter clinical trials (NCT02122913, \nNCT02637687, and NCT02576431) that demonstrated \nmarked and durable antitumor activity of larotrectinib in \n55 patients with 17 TRK fusion-positive cancers, includ-\ning pancreatic cancer [188]. The ORR was 75%, and 86% \nof the patients who responded were either continuing \ntreatment or had undergone surgery at a median follow-\nup of 9.4 months. Notably, this study included only one \npatient with pancreatic cancer. In 2019, the FDA also \napproved another TRK inhibitor, entrectinib, for solid \ntumors with NTRK gene fusions. This approval was sup-\nported by an analysis of three phase I-II trials (ALKA-\n372-001, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2), which found \nthat entrectinib induced durable and clinically meaning-\nful responses in patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid \ntumors (Fig.  1) [189]. Among the 54 patients enrolled, \nthe ORR was 57%, and 7% achieved complete responses. \nThis study included three patients with pancreatic can-\ncer. Additionally, in 2022, the FDA approved dabrafenib \nand trametinib for solid tumors with ­BRAFV600E muta-\ntions, based on the results of the NCI-MATCH Trial \n(NCT02465060) Subprotocol H, which reported an \nORR of 38% and a PFS of 11.4 months, with responses \nobserved across seven different tumor types, including \npancreatic cancer (Fig. 1) [190]. In the same year, selp-\nercatinib received FDA approval for rearranged dur-\ning transfection (RET) fusion-positive solid tumors, \nbased on the results of the LIBRETTO-001 basket trial \n(NCT03157128), which achieved an ORR of 54.5% in \npancreatic cancer patients (Fig. 1) [191].\nNovel therapeutic development for pancreatic \nCancer\nEmerging immunotherapeutic strategies beyond current \nstandards\nAs described above, pancreatic cancer is character-\nized by low immunogenicity and immunosuppressive \nTME. Although immunotherapy still holds a promise \nas a potential breakthrough for pancreatic cancer, novel \napproaches for immunotherapy must be taken to over-\ncome both low immunogenicity and immunosuppressive \nTME in pancreatic cancer (Fig. 2) [158, 192]– [194].\nCancer vaccines\nWhole‑cell vaccines  Due to a lack of knowledge on spe-\ncific pancreatic tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), whole-\ncell vaccines were developed for treating pancreatic can-\ncer, particularly the GVAX vaccine [195]. The pancreatic"}, {"page_number": 19, "text": "Page 19 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \n\t\ncancer GVAX developed by Johns Hopkins University is \ncomprised of two, irradiated, allogenic human PDAC cell \nlines transfected with granulocyte–macrophage colony-\nstimulating factor (GM-CSF) and administered intrader-\nmally. In its phase I trial, 14 pancreatic cancer patients \nreceiving multiple vaccinations after pancreaticoduo-\ndenectomy demonstrated its safety and tolerability, with \nthree patients remaining disease-free for over 10  years \n[195]. A subsequent phase II study with 60 resected PDAC \npatients reported median DFS of 17.3 months and OS of \n24.8 months [196]. Through these studies, mesothelin was \nidentified as pancreatic cancer-associated T cell antigens \nand demonstrated that mesothelin-specific ­CD8+ T cell \nresponses correlated with longer survival [197]. Further \ninvestigation demonstrated that combining GVAX with \nlow-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) to deplete regulatory T \ncells (Tregs) resulted in higher avidity mesothelin-specific \nT cell responses and longer survival with minimal toxic-\nity in patients with metastatic PDAC compared to GVAX \nalone [198].\nFig. 2  Immunomodulatory strategies for reprogramming the tumor microenvironment to enhance antitumor immunity. The pancreatic \ntumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by an abundance of immunosuppressive cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), \ntumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), all embedded \nwithin a dense fibrotic stroma. Targeting these immunosuppressive myeloid cells involves inhibiting pathways such as CSF-1R, CCL2/CCR2, \nCXCR1/2, CXCL8, and CXCL12/CXCR4, while activating CD40 and CD11b to prevent their migration and reduce immunosuppression. Innate \nimmune responses are stimulated through small molecule innate agonists or radiation to create a proinflammatory microenvironment and boost \nantitumor immunity. Cancer vaccines—including whole-cell, antigen-specific, and neoantigen-based vaccines—activate dendritic cells (DCs) \nto present tumor antigens, promoting targeted immune responses. Cell therapies, including TILs, CAR-T, CAR-NK, and TCR-engineered T-cell \ntherapies, are employed to enhance cytotoxic activity against tumor cells by targeting specific antigens such as HER2, CEA, EGFR, mesothelin, \nand mutant KRAS. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4, and other emerging checkpoints like LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT \nare utilized to unleash T cell-mediated responses, overcoming immune evasion within the TME. Additionally, stroma modulation is achieved \nthrough the use of MMP inhibitors, TGF-β inhibitors, FAP-targeting agents, and FAK inhibitors, which disrupt the tumor-supportive environment. \nThese strategies collectively aim to shift the TME from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory state, augmenting therapeutic outcomes \nin pancreatic cancer, particularly when combined with chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy"}, {"page_number": 20, "text": "Page 20 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \nAnother allogenic whole-cell vaccine that had shown \nclinical promise in pancreatic cancer is algenpantucel-L \nwhich leverages the concept of hyperacute rejection by \nusing PDAC cell lines engineered to express α-galactose \nepitopes on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids to \ninduce immune-mediated tumor cell destruction [199]. \nThe phase II trial evaluating algenpantucel-L plus gemcit-\nabine or 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy in patients with \nresected pancreatic cancer showed that algenpantucel-L \nimproved survival to a 12-month DFS at 62% and OS at \n86% [200]. However, the subsequent phase III trial failed \nto support the efficacy of algenpantucel-L [201].\nVaccine therapy to  prime TME  As vaccine therapy by \nitself has a limited efficacy, the institution focused on \nevaluating changes in the TME of pancreatic cancer fol-\nlowing GVAX treatment. A window-of-opportunity neo-\nadjuvant clinical trial for resectable pancreatic cancer \nwas developed and demonstrated that GVAX treatment \ninduces intratumoral tertiary lymphoid aggregates, indi-\ncating the conversion of pancreatic cancer from a non-\nimmunogenic tumor into an immunogenic one [202, \n203]. The study also raised the hypothesis that vaccine \ntherapy primes the TME and thus sensitize pancreatic \ncancer for ICI treatment. This hypothesis was tested in a \nfollowup clinical trial with the same neoadjuvant therapy \nplatform design (NCT02451982). The study showed that, \nin response to anti-PD-1 nivolumab treatment, GVAX-\ninduced tertiary lymphoid aggregates became immune-\nregulatory sites. The study also found that higher densi-\nties of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) following \nthe combination of GVAX and nivolumab portend poorer \nOS, leading to the development of a new arm in this \nplatform trial to test the combination of nivolumab and \nanti-interleukin 8 (IL-8) antibody that blocks TANs [204]. \nThe clinical trial added another arm to test anti-CD137 \nagonist antibody urelumab in combination of GAVX and \nnivolumab because the study found that ­CD8+  T cell \nexpression of CD137 was required for optimal T cell acti-\nvation and that increased T cells expressing CD137 cor-\nrelated with increased OS [202, 204, 205]. This new arm \nshowed that the triple combination of GVAX, nivolumab, \nand urelumab meets the primary endpoint by significantly \nincreasing intratumoral ­CD137+CD8+ T cells compared \nto the double combination of GVAX and Nivolumab and \nresulted in a numerically improved DFS to 33.51 months \nand OS to 35.55 months although the improvement is not \nstatistically significant due to small sample size [206].\nAntigen‑specific vaccines  The development of antigen-\nspecific vaccines has not been successful in pancreatic \ncancer treatment by stimulating the immune system to \ntarget tumor-specific antigens. Several peptide-based \nvaccines are currently under investigation. GV1001, \nderived from the telomerase reverse-transcriptase por-\ntion, showed significant immune responses and improved \nmedian survival in a phase I/II trial of advanced pancre-\natic cancer patients [207]. However, a subsequent phase \nIII trial combining GV1001 with chemotherapy did not \nsignificantly improve OS, suggesting that new strategies \nare required to enhance the immune response to telom-\nerase vaccines during chemotherapy [208]. Another vac-\ncine, KIF20A-66, demonstrated safety and modest effi-\ncacy in a phase I/II trial [209]. Interestingly, a phase I trial \ncombining KIF20A-derived peptide with gemcitabine in \nadvanced pancreatic cancer patients showed no serious \nadverse effects and induced interferon (IFN)-γ-producing \ncells in four out of nine patients [210, 211]. Additional \nphase II trials confirmed these results, indicating promise \nfor this combination therapy in advanced pancreatic can-\ncer [212, 213]. Mucin-1 (MUC-1), a transmembrane pro-\ntein overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, has also been tar-\ngeted with peptide vaccines. Initial clinical trials showed \nthat MUC-1-specific vaccines could elicit T cell responses \nand potentially improve OS [214]. Additionally, den-\ndritic cell (DC)-based vaccines loaded with peptides like \nWilms tumor 1 (WT1) and MUC-1 combined with stand-\nard chemotherapy in patients with advanced or relapsed \nPDAC have shown enhanced tumor-specific immunity \nand favorable outcomes, with the median PFS and OS as \n8.1  months and 15.1  months, respectively [215]. These \nresults suggest that peptide-based and DC vaccines, espe-\ncially when combined with conventional therapies, hold \npotential for improving outcomes in pancreatic cancer, \nparticularly in patients with recurrent or refractory dis-\nease [216].\nMesothelin-specific immune responses observed in \npatients with increased DFS after receiving GVAX have \npositioned mesothelin as a promising candidate for anti-\ngen-specific vaccines [197]. CRS-207, a recombinant live-\nattenuated Listeria monocytogenes engineered to secrete \ntumor antigens, was developed to stimulate both innate \nand adaptive immunity. In a phase II trial, combining Cy/\nGVAX with CRS-207 in metastatic pancreatic cancer \npatients resulted in a median OS of 6.1  months, com-\npared to 3.9 months for Cy/GVAX alone, and 9.7 months \nversus 4.6 months for those receiving at least three doses \nof the vaccine [217]. However, a later phase IIb trial \nfound no survival advantage for the combination of Cy/\nGVAX and CRS-207 over single-agent chemotherapy in \npreviously treated metastatic pancreatic cancer patients \n[218]. Despite the initial promising results, including \nimmunological activation and mesothelin-specific T-cell \nresponses, further studies are needed to determine the \nefficacy of CRS-207 in PDAC. A recent trial also evalu-\nated the combination of Cy/GVAX and CRS-207 with or"}, {"page_number": 21, "text": "Page 21 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \n\t\nwithout nivolumab (NCT02243371), showing non-dura-\nble objective responses in a small percentage of patients, \nbut significant immunological changes in the TME \n[219]. This result suggests the need for further ongo-\ning research to optimize combined treatment strategies \nwith antigen-specific cancer vaccines such as CRS-207 \n(NCT03006302, NCT05014776).\nNeoantigen‑based vaccines  Neoantigen-based vaccines \nare an emerging approach in cancer immunotherapy, \nleveraging the immunogenicity of tumor-specific muta-\ntions. Neoepitopes, which arise from these mutations, \ncan be recognized by T cells, offering a targeted immune \nresponse against the tumor [220]. Although pancreatic \ncancers have a lower mutation rate compared to mela-\nnoma or NSCLC, they still express neoepitopes that can \nserve as potent targets for vaccination. The rationale is \nthat these neoepitopes are less likely to evade the immune \nsystem, making neoantigen-based vaccines more immu-\nnogenic [221].\nOncogenic mutations in KRAS are present in up \nto 90% of PDAC, making vaccination against mutant \nKRAS \n(mKRAS) \na \npromising \nimmunotherapeutic \napproach. Johns Hopkins University has developed an \nmKRAS peptide vaccine targeting six common KRAS \nmutations (G12V, G12A, G12C, G12R, G12D, G13D) \n(NCT04117087). In an early trial, the vaccine, combined \nwith ipilimumab and nivolumab, showed that 8 out of \n11 patients with resected PDAC developed a significant \nmKRAS-specific T cell response, characterized by an \nincrease in IFNγ-producing T cells. Cytometry by time-\nof-flight analysis revealed the expansion of polyfunctional \nmKRAS-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, with CD4 T cells \nbeing more prominently induced. Single-cell analysis fur-\nther identified a novel ­CD4+ T cell receptor (TCR) that \nrecognizes ­KRASG12V in the context of human leukocyte \nantigens (HLA)-DRB1*07:01, underscoring the vaccine’s \npotential to induce high-quality T cells. Ongoing studies \nare focused on further characterizing TCR diversity and \nclonality to identify biomarkers for predicting response \nto mKRAS-targeted immunotherapy [222]. Additionally, \na phase II trial (NCT06411691) is evaluating the efficacy \nand immune response of this mKRAS vaccine combined \nwith Balstilimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) and Botensili-\nmab (an anti-CTLA-4 antibody) in patients with unre-\nsectable or MMR-p colorectal cancer or PDAC, following \nfirst-line FOLFIRINOX/FOLFOXIRI treatment, aiming \nto expand upon these initial findings in a broader patient \npopulation.\nDespite their promise, peptide vaccines face several \nchallenges, including HLA-type restriction, which lim-\nits their use to patients with matching HLA types, and \nthe frequent occurrence of immune evasion when the \nvaccine’s anti-tumor activity relies on a response to a sin-\ngle epitope. Additionally, peptide- or protein-based vac-\ncines often require combination with adequate immune \nadjuvants or vectors to elicit a strong immune response \n[223]. To address these issues, researchers are developing \nimmune-dominant antigens that can trigger responses to \nmultiple epitopes and creating new vaccine vector sys-\ntems to enhance efficacy. A promising development in \novercoming these challenges is the ELI-002 2P vaccine, \nwhich targets KRAS mutations (G12D and G12R) with \nmodified long peptides and a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 \nagonist, found in a significant portion of solid tumors. In \na first-in-human phase I trial, ELI-002 2P demonstrated \nrobust immunogenicity in 84% of patients with minimal \nresidual disease relapse after locoregional treatment. \nImportantly, this vaccine does not require HLA-type \nmatching, effectively overcoming one of the major limita-\ntions of traditional peptide vaccines. The induced T cell \nresponses correlated with significant reductions in tumor \nbiomarkers and improved relapse-free survival, high-\nlighting the potential of ELI-002 2P as a promising thera-\npeutic option for patients with KRAS-mutated tumors \n[224].\nOne promising example is autogene cevumeran, an \nmRNA vaccine designed similarly to COVID-19 vac-\ncines, formulated with uridine mRNA-lipoplex nano-\nparticles encoding up to 20 neoantigens per patient. In a \nphase I trial (NCT04161755), patients underwent tumor \nresection, followed by a single dose of anti-PD-L1 anti-\nbody atezolizumab six weeks post-surgery, eight doses of \nautogene cevumeran, standard adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX, \nand a ninth vaccine booster dose upon completion of \nmFOLFIRINOX [225]. Initial results showed that this \ncombination was safe and feasible, generating substan-\ntial neoantigen-specific T cell responses in 50% of unse-\nlected resectable PDAC patients. The vaccine-induced T \ncells, which could comprise up to 10% of the total circu-\nlating T cells, demonstrated significant clonal expansion \nand targeted pancreatic cancer neoantigens. Responders \nto the vaccine had significantly prolonged recurrence-\nfree survival compared to non-responders (median not \nreached versus 13.7 months) after a median follow-up of \n18 months [225]. The eight patients with vaccine-induced \nT-cell responses continued to have significantly longer \nmedian recurrence-free survival compared to those with-\nout an immune response after a median follow-up of \n3 years [226]. These encouraging results have led to the \ninitiation of a randomized phase II trial (IMCODE003, \nNCT05968326) to further evaluate the efficacy and safety \nof autogene cevumeran in combination with atezoli-\nzumab and mFOLFIRINOX as adjuvant therapy, com-\npared to standard-of-care mFOLFIRINOX, in patients \nwith resectable pancreatic cancer (NCT05968326)."}, {"page_number": 22, "text": "Page 22 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \nDespite the potential of neoantigen-based immuno-\ntherapy, it faces significant challenges in pancreatic can-\ncer. High intertumoral heterogeneity and the scarcity of \nshared mutations complicate the development of person-\nalized treatments. Additionally, the specialized TME in \nPDAC limits the effectiveness of immunotherapy, making \nneoantigen-based strategies more viable as complemen-\ntary treatments rather than standalone options. These \nchallenges have driven ongoing research to overcome \nthese barriers and enhance the effectiveness of these \ntherapies (Table 5) [221].\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors\nPD‑1/PD‑L1 axis and  CTLA‑4  Following the success \nof anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies in melanoma, researchers \nbegan exploring the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in PDAC. \nThe interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 leads to T cell \nexhaustion by blocking T cell activation, while CTLA-4 \ninhibition can modulate Tregs and enhance T cell prim-\ning [227]. However, these ICIs have not yielded significant \nclinical benefits in pancreatic cancer, which is often char-\nacterized by a lack of pre-existing T cell immunity [228, \n229]. For instance, the KEYNOTE-028 trial found that \npancreatic cancer was the only tumor type among 475 PD-\nL1-positive advanced solid tumors that did not respond \nto pembrolizumab therapy [230]. Even in the small sub-\nset of PDAC patients with MSI-H or high TMB profiles, \nresponses to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are less robust com-\npared to other MSI-H tumors [164, 163, 231]. Similarly, \nclinical trials investigating CTLA-4 inhibitors in PDAC \nhave been disappointing, with minimal efficacy and chal-\nlenging side effect profiles [232]. Additionally, unlike in \nother solid tumors, combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-\nCTLA-4 therapies has not substantially improved out-\ncomes in pancreatic cancer. For instance, a phase II trial \nevaluating durvalumab with or without tremelimumab \nin previously treated metastatic PDAC patients reported \nan ORR of 3.1% for the combination therapy and 0% for \nmonotherapy, with no significant improvement in PFS \n(1.5 vs 1.5 months) or OS (3.1 vs 3.6 months) [233].\nGiven these challenges, ongoing clinical trials are \nfocusing on combining ICIs with chemotherapy and/or \nradiotherapy to enhance antitumor responses in pancre-\natic cancer. For instance, the CISPD-4 randomized phase \nII trial (NCT03983057) is investigating mFOLFIRINOX \nwith or without anti-PD-1 antibody as neoadjuvant ther-\napy in BRPC and LAPC. Preliminary data suggest similar \nresection rates between the two groups in BRPC (51.7% \nvs 47.4%), with a higher resection rate observed in the \nPD-1 group for LAPC (48.0% vs 37.1%) [234]. However, \ncombining anti-CTLA-4 therapy with chemotherapy has \nnot demonstrated superiority over PD-1 combinations. \nFor instance, a phase Ib study combining ipilimumab \nwith gemcitabine in advanced PDAC reported an ORR \nof 14% and a median OS of 6.9 months, indicating that \nwhile the combination is safe, it does not offer signifi-\ncant efficacy advantages over gemcitabine alone [159]. \nSimilarly, the CCTG PA.7 phase II trial (NCT02879318) \nfound that adding durvalumab and tremelimumab to \ngemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel did not significantly improve \nmedian OS (9.8 vs 8.8  months) in metastatic PDAC, \nthough it slightly increased ORR (30.3% vs 23.0%) [235]. \nOverall, these findings suggest that while combinations \nof PD-1/PD-L1 and/or CTLA-4 inhibitors with chemo-\ntherapy or other treatment methods are being actively \ninvestigated, further research is needed to identify the \nsubsets of PDAC patients who may benefit most from \nthese regimens (Table 6).\nOthers  Despite significant advancements, the efficacy \nof antibodies targeting CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 has not \nbeen satisfactory in all cases. This has prompted research-\ners to explore new immune checkpoints as potential tar-\ngets for ICIs. Three promising candidates currently under \nclinical investigation are lymphocyte activation gene-3 \n(LAG-3), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain con-\ntaining-3 (TIM3), and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and \nITIM domains (TIGIT) [236].\nLAG-3, also known as CD223, is expressed on various \ncell types, including ­CD4+ and ­CD8+ T cells, as well as \nTregs, and plays a crucial role in T cell regulation and \nhomeostasis [237]. In cancer, persistent antigen stimula-\ntion leads to chronic LAG-3 expression, contributing to T \ncell exhaustion [238]. Several neutralizing antibodies tar-\ngeting LAG-3, including relatlimab, fianlimab, and favez-\nelimab, are currently in phase III clinical trials for various \ncancers, although none have been tested specifically in \nPDAC [239]. Interestingly, unlike PD-1 and CTLA-4, \nwhich inhibit CD28-mediated co-stimulation, LAG-3 \nimpedes the TCR signal, suggesting that combined tar-\ngeting of these pathways may be beneficial [240, 241]. \nPreclinical studies in murine models of melanoma, colon \nadenocarcinoma, and ovarian cancer have demonstrated \nthat co-blockade of LAG-3 and PD-1, expressed on both \n­CD4+ and ­CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), \nenhances anti-tumor responses [241, 242]. Relatlimab, \nthe first FDA-approved LAG-3 inhibitor, in combination \nwith nivolumab (marketed as Opdualag), has been shown \nto double median PFS (10.1 vs 4.6  months) in patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic melanoma compared \nto nivolumab alone, highlighting the potential efficacy \nof targeting LAG-3 in cancer therapies [243].

In a previously men-\ntioned clinical study combining GVAX vaccine and \nnivolumab as neoadjuvant therapy for resectable PDAC \n(NCT02451982), it was observed that higher densities of \nTANs in vaccine-induced tertiary lymphoid aggregates \nwithin the TME were correlated with increased densities \nof LAG-3+ tumor-infiltrating T cells, but not with TIM-\n3+ or ­EOMES+ T cells [204]. This finding suggests that \nmodulating TANs in PDAC may facilitate the recovery of \nexhausted T cell populations through LAG-3 targeting.\nTIM-3 regulates type 1 immune responses and is \nexpressed on IFNγ-secreting ­CD4+ and ­CD8+ T lympho-\ncytes, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid cells, mast cells, \nand a subset of B lymphocytes [246, 247]. TIM-3 has \nbeen identified as a marker of terminally dysfunctional \n­CD8+ T cells more effectively than PD-1 in both cancer \nmodels and human samples, making it a promising tar-\nget for immunotherapy [248, 249]. Moreover, TIM-3 is \nhighly expressed on ­Foxp3+ Tregs, adding complexity to \nits role in immune regulation [250]. Since 2016, several \nanti-TIM-3 antibodies and PD-1/TIM-3 bispecific anti-\nbodies, such as TSR-022 (Tesaro), have entered clinical \ntrials. However, these therapies have not yet been tested \nin pancreatic cancers.\nTIGIT is a co-inhibitory receptor induced by TCR \nstimulation, expressed on NK cells, Tregs, Th1 cells, fol-\nlicular Th cells, and dysfunctional ­CD8+ T cells [251]– \n[254]. TIGIT’s ligands, CD155 and CD112, are shared \nwith DNAM-1 and are found on antigen-presenting \ncells and tumor cells [255]. High TIGIT expression in \nPDAC-infiltrating T cells correlates with anti-inflamma-\ntory and exhausted phenotypes, highlighting its poten-\ntial as a therapeutic target [256]. Ongoing trials such \nas NCT03193190 are testing the efficacy of combining \ntiragolumab, a TIGIT monoclonal antibody, with other \ntherapies in metastatic PDAC (Table 6).\nAgents targeted tumor microenvironment\nActivation of innate immunity  The innate immune sys-\ntem, primarily composed of myeloid/macrophages, NK \ncells, and DCs, represents the first line of defense against \ninvading microbial pathogens. This system utilizes pat-\ntern recognition receptors (PRRs) to identify conserved \nstructures on pathogens, known as pathogen-associated \nmolecular patterns [257]. However, research has shown \nthat innate immune activation can also occur in the \nabsence of pathogen infection, a process termed ster-\nile inflammation. Sterile inflammation is often associ-\nated with radiation-induced innate immune responses, \nwhere PRRs detect damage-associated molecular patterns \n(DAMPs) originating from stressed or damaged cells \n[258]. The ligation of PRRs, such as TLRs and the cyclic \nGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon \ngenes (STING) signaling pathway, has been investigated \nto enhance proinflammatory DC phenotypes and bol-\nster antitumor immunity in PDAC. Radiation can induce \nDAMPs, further enhancing PRR-mediated activation of \nthe immune system, which complements the effects of \nimmunotherapy [259].\nTLR3 agonist Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is expressed \nin various cell types, including DCs, macrophages, epi-\nthelial cells, and fibroblasts [260, 261]. In myeloid lin-\neage cells, TLR3 functions as a cell surface receptor \nrecognizing viral double-stranded RNA motifs, con-\ntributing to innate antiviral responses [262]. In tumors, \nTLR3 activation triggers interferon regulatory factor \n3, leading to IFN-β production, which inhibits tumor \ngrowth and angiogenesis. It also enhances the activation \nand proliferation of tumor-specific T cells while induc-\ning caspase-dependent apoptosis [263].

Current clinical trials are investigating \nthe combination of Rintatolimod with FOLFIRINOX \n(NCT05494697) or anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab \n(NCT05927142) in locally advanced or metastatic PDAC \n[271].\nTLR7/8 agonist TLR7 and TLR8 share structural motifs \nand are both  localized within intracellular endosomal \ncompartments [272]. Natural agonists, such as single-\nstranded RNA or deoxyribonucleotides with cytosine-\nphosphate-guanine motifs, activate innate immune cells \nthrough these TLRs [273]. TLR7 is primarily expressed \nby plasmacytoid DCs and B cells, while TLR8 is \nexpressed by myeloid lineage cells, including monocytes, \nmacrophages, and myeloid DCs [272]. A study investigat-\ning TLR expression in pancreatic cancer patients receiv-\ning neoadjuvant therapy found that TLR7 and TLR9 were \nboth associated with favorable postoperative outcomes \n[274]. At present, the AGADIR trial (NCT03915678), a \nmulticenter, phase II study is evaluating the novel TLR7/8 \nagonist BDB001 in combination with atezolizumab and \nSBRT in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarci-\nnoma. This study met its first endpoint for disease con-\ntrol rate (DCR) at 38.0%, and of the 21 patients enrolled, \n9.5% achieved a partial response, 28.5% had stable dis-\nease, and 62.0% experienced progressive disease [275].\nTLR9 agonist TLR9 is a PRR expressed intracellularly \nin various immune effector cells, including DCs, mac-\nrophages, and NK cells [276]. TLR9 agonism has been \nshown to enhance immune responses, circumvent tumor \nimmune evasion, and optimize immunotherapy out-\ncomes [277, 278]. SD-101 is a synthetic oligonucleotide \ncontaining cytidine-phospho-guanosine (CpG) motifs \nthat stimulates plasmacytoid DCs via TLR9, leading to \nIFN-α release and maturation into antigen-presenting \ncells, thereby enhancing innate and adaptive immune \nresponses [279]. A pilot study combining intratumoral \nSD-101 with nivolumab and radiotherapy for chemother-\napy-refractory metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma has \nbeen completed, with results pending (NCT04050085) \n[280]. Additionally, the PERIO-03 pilot study is currently \nevaluating the intratumoral administration of SD-101 \nvia pressure-enabled intrapancreatic infusion along-\nside nivolumab in patients with LAPC, demonstrating \nfavorable tolerability and potentially beneficial immune \nalterations, such as decreases in myeloid-derived sup-\npressor cells (MDSCs)-associated gene expression in \nboth peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumors \n(NCT05607953) [281].\nSTING agonist STING is a transmembrane protein \nlocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum that, upon bind-\ning with cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine \nmonophosphate, induces the production of class I inter-\nferons in DCs [282, 283]. STING agonists, which activate \ninnate immune responses and counteract tumor-induced \nimmunosuppression, are emerging as promising agents \nin cancer immunotherapy [284]. While first-generation \nsynthetic cyclic dinucleotide based STING agonists \nshowed encouraging preclinical results, challenges such \nas technical difficulties with intratumoral delivery, sys-\ntemic toxicity, and tumor resistance have limited their \nclinical application [285]. This has led to the development \nof new generation STING agonists suitable for systemic \nadministration, such as BMS-986301 (NCT03956680), \nTAK-676 (NCT04420884), and SNX281 (NCT04609579) \n[286, 287]. BMS-986301, for example, has demonstrated \nsimilar efficacy with intramuscular injection compared \nto traditional intratumoral injection in preclinical stud-\nies, and it attenuates T cell exhaustion and immunosup-\npressive signals while upregulating CTLA-4 checkpoint \nsignals in tumor-infiltrating T cells [288]. This led to \nthe initiation of a clinical trial combining BMS-986301 \nwith nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced solid can-\ncers (NCT03956680). Another innovative, systemically \nadministered innate agonist is Decoy20, a detoxified, \ninactivated bacterial product that retains agonistic activ-\nity for multiple innate immune pathways, including \nendogenous TLR1,2,6,8,9, nucleotide oligomerization \ndomain containing 2, and STING. Early results from a \nphase I trial in advanced solid malignancies showed sys-\ntemic immune activation and preliminary evidence of \nstable disease after only one infusion (NCT05651022) \n[289, 290].\nRadiation as an innate immune agonist Emerging evi-\ndence suggests that radiotherapy can initiate an innate \nimmune response by inducing immunogenic cell death \nand subsequently activating adaptive immunity, function-\ning as an \"in situ vaccination\" within the TME [259, 291, \n292]. Preclinical studies support combining radiotherapy \nwith ICIs in pancreatic cancer [293, 294], with clinical \ntrials showing modest benefits and well-tolerated safety \nin metastatic PDAC when radiotherapy is combined with \nICIs like durvalumab, tremelimumab, ipilimumab, and \nnivolumab [295, 296]. Notably, the randomized phase \nII CheckPAC study (NCT02866383) demonstrated that \ncombining SBRT with nivolumab and ipilimumab sig-\nnificantly improved antitumor activity in chemotherapy-\nrefractory metastatic PDAC patients compared to SBRT \nwith nivolumab alone, showing higher clinical benefit \nrate (37.2% vs 17.1%) and ORR (14.0% vs 2.4%) [297]. \nHowever, results from the phase II TRIPLE-R study \n(NCT04258150) of ipilimumab, nivolumab, IL-6 inhibi-\ntor tocilizumab combined with SBRT indicated limited \nefficacy, with no observed responses and a median OS of \nonly 5.3 months, potentially due to the complex role of \nIL-6 in the PDAC microenvironment [298]. Overall, while \ncombining radiotherapy with immunotherapy has shown"}, {"page_number": 28, "text": "Page 28 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \npotential, the integration of precision radiotherapy with \nmore personalized and diverse immunotherapy regimens \nis crucial in PDAC treatment [299]. For instance, com-\nbining GVAX, PD-1 blockade pembrolizumab, and SBRT \nin LAPC patients (NCT02648282) increased antitumor \nimmune responses but also elevated immunosuppressive \nM2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), high-\nlighting the need for further studies targeting TAMs in \nradioimmunotherapy [300, 301].\nTargeting myeloid cells  Myeloid cells play a critical role \nin shaping the TME of PDAC, significantly contribut-\ning to tumor progression and immune evasion. These \ncells, which include macrophages, neutrophils, DCs, and \nMDSCs, often adopt phenotypes that support tumor \ngrowth and suppress anti-tumor immune responses [158, \n302, 303].\nCSF-1R inhibitor The recruitment and survival of \nTAMs in PDAC are regulated by the colony-stimulating \nfactor 1 (CSF-1)/CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) axis and the \nCCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway [304, 305]. Preclinical \nmodels have demonstrated that blocking CSF-1R can \nreprogram TAMs to enhance antigen presentation and \nprime anti-tumor T cell responses [306]. Early-phase \nclinical investigations with inhibitors targeting CCR2 \nand CSF-1R showed promise in advanced PDAC patients \n[307, 308]. Recent research utilizing data from the TCGA \nPanCancer Atlas categorized PDAC patients into CSF-1R \nhigh and CSF-1R low groups, revealing that higher CSF-\n1R expression correlates with increased immune infil-\ntration. This suggests potential for targeting CSF-1R in \ncombination immunotherapy strategies for PDAC [309]. \nA clinical trial explored the safety and immunologic \neffects of combining GVAX with Cy, pembrolizumab, \nand IMC-CS4 (a CSF-1R inhibitor) in PDAC patients \n(NCT03153410) [310]. The study reported a median DFS \nof 12.6 months and OS of 20.4 months, with 78% achiev-\ning major pathological response post-surgery. Notably, \nwhile the primary immunologic endpoint was met, show-\ning an increase in ­CD8+ T cells and ­CD8+Granzyme ­B+ \nT cells, no significant change in myeloid cell density was \nobserved, suggesting that the treatment reprogrammed \nrather than depleted the macrophages [310]. However, \na recent phase II study (NCT03336216) that combined \nthe CSF-1R inhibitor cabiralizumab with nivolumab and \nchemotherapy did not significantly improve median PFS \ncompared to chemotherapy alone in advanced PDAC \npatients (3.68  months, 3.22  months, and 3.25  months, \nrespectively) [311]. The failure of this cabiralizumab-\nbased regimen may be attributed to ineffective targeting \nof myeloid cells, lack of T cell priming agents, or inade-\nquate combinatorial effects from chemotherapy. Pexidar-\ntinib, a more potent CSF-1R inhibitor, was evaluated in a \nsmall phase I study (NCT02777710) involving pancreatic \nand colorectal cancer patients (n = 19). The combination \nof pexidartinib and the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab \nshowed a response rate of 21% among the 19 enrolled \npatients [312]. Further analysis suggested that pexidar-\ntinib impacts Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-dependent DC \ndifferentiation and may antagonize the effect of dur-\nvalumab, indicating that inhibition of Fms-like tyrosine \nkinase 3 should be considered when combining CSF-1R \ninhibitors with PD-L1 inhibitors [313].\nCCL2/CCR2 antagonist CCR2 and its ligand CCL2 are \ncrucial in recruiting immunosuppressive cells, such as \nM2-like TAMs and MDSCs, into tumors [314]. In PDAC, \nelevated CCL2 expression alongside low ­CD8+ T cell \ninfiltration is associated with significantly poorer patient \nsurvival [315]. Preclinical studies have shown that dis-\nrupting the CCL2–CCR2 axis can enhance chemother-\napy efficacy and bolster antitumor T cell responses [305, \n316]. A phase Ib study (NCT01413022) exploring the \ncombination of the CCR2 antagonist PF-04136309 with \nFOLFIRINOX in patients with BRPC and LAPC reported \na promising ORR of 49% in 33 evaluable patients, with no \ndose-limiting toxicities observed [307]. However, a sub-\nsequent trial combining PF-04136309 with gemcitabine/\nnab-paclitaxel revealed a high incidence of pulmonary \ntoxicity (24%) and did not demonstrate an efficacy advan-\ntage over chemotherapy alone [317]. CCR5, another \nchemokine receptor, plays a role in TAM and Treg infil-\ntration into tumors [318]. Preclinical research indicated \nthat a dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonist BMS-687681 could \ncounteract radiotherapy-induced suppressive signals in \nmyeloid cells and upregulate effector T cell pathways, \nthus supporting an ongoing clinical trial combining radi-\notherapy, a CCR2/CCR5 dual antagonist BMS-813160, \nand nivolumab for LAPC treatment(NCT03767582) [319, \n320]. Additionally, a phase Ib/II trial (NCT03184870) \nis currently assessing BMS-813160 as monotherapy or \nin combination with chemotherapy or nivolumab in \npatients with advanced pancreatic or colorectal cancer. \nThe trial has completed enrollment, and its results are \nawaited [321, 322].\nCD40 agonist CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis \nfactor receptor superfamily, is predominantly expressed \non DCs, macrophages, and B cells [323]. Its ligand, \nCD40L, is primarily found on activated T cells and inter-\nacts with CD40 on antigen-presenting cells, promoting \nthe upregulation of IL-12, MHC-II, costimulatory, and \nadhesion molecules. CD40 agonist immunotherapy lev-\nerages this interaction to stimulate endogenous effector \nT cells via host conventional DCs, providing a robust \ntherapeutic benefit [324]. There are several agonis-\ntic anti-CD40 antibodies, such as SGN-40, SEA-CD40, \nselicrelumab, APX005M, CDX-1140, and ADC1013,"}, {"page_number": 29, "text": "Page 29 of 59\nWang et al.

In a phase I study eval-\nuating the CD40 agonist selicrelumab as neoadjuvant \ntherapy in resectable PDAC (NCT02588443), treated \npatients exhibited more mature DCs, more active and \nproliferative T cells, fewer M2-like TAMs, and reduced \nfibrosis compared to treatment-naïve or chemotherapy-\nonly patients [326]. When combined with chemothera-\npeutic agents like gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, which \ninduce PDAC cellular apoptosis and expose TAAs, CD40 \nengagement has been shown to induce DC-dependent \ncellular immune responses [327]. In a prior phase I trial, \ncombining CD40 agonism CP-870893 with gemcitabine \nin advanced PDAC resulted in an ORR of 19%, with a \nmedian PFS of 5.2 months and OS of 8.4 months [328]. \nA phase Ib trial combining gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, \nand the CD40 agonist APX005M (sotigalimab), with or \nwithout the anti-PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab for metastatic \nPDAC (NCT03214250), reported an ORR of 58% among \nthe 24 evaluated subjects, though most participants expe-\nrienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, \nincluding lymphopenia, anemia, and neutropenia [329]. \nDespite these promising results, the subsequent phase II \nPRINCE trial (NCT03214250) for first-line treatment of \nmetastatic PDAC revealed that the primary endpoint of \n1-year OS was only met for the nivolumab plus chemo-\ntherapy group (57.7% compared to a historical 1-year OS \nof 35%), but not for the sotigalimab plus chemotherapy \n(48.1%) or sotigalimab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy \ngroups (41.3%) [330]. These findings suggest that CD40 \nagonist regimens may not be optimal for unselected \nPDAC, although several immune signatures identified \nare being further evaluated in the ongoing REVOLU-\nTION platform trial (NCT04787991) [331]. Addition-\nally, combination therapy using a DC vaccine loaded with \ntumor antigens and CD40 agonism has shown promise in \nenhancing tumor-specific T cell responses. The phase Ib/\nII OPTIMIZE-1 study (NCT04888312), which evaluated \nmitazalimab, a human CD40 agonistic IgG1 antibody \ncombined with mFOLFIRINOX in previously untreated \nmetastatic PDAC, demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor \nactivity with an ORR of 40% among the 57 evaluated \npatients [332]. An ongoing phase I REACTIVE-2 trial \n(NCT05650918) is currently assessing the safety and \ntumor-specific immunologic endpoints of a DC vaccine \nloaded with tumor lysates in combination with CD40 \nagonism [333].\nCD11b \nagonist \nIntegrin \nαMβ2 \n(CD11b/CD18), \nexpressed on macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and \nsome DC subsets, plays a crucial role in leukocyte adhe-\nsion to vasculature and transmigration under inflamma-\ntory conditions by binding fibrinogen and endothelial \nICAM-1 [334, 335]. Preclinical evidence suggests that the \nsmall molecule CD11b agonist ADH-503 may suppress \nmyeloid infiltration into inflamed sites by enhancing \nCD11b-dependent adhesion to endothelial ICAM-1 \n[336]. Partial CD11b activation by ADH-503 led to TAM \nrepolarization, reduced immunosuppressive infiltrates, \nand enhanced DC responses in PDAC models, thereby \nimproving antitumor T cell immunity and the efficacy \nof checkpoint inhibitors [337]. However, a phase I trial \nof the CD11b modulator GB1275 as monotherapy or \nin combination with pembrolizumab in advanced solid \ntumors, including PDAC, was terminated due to lack of \nobserved benefit (NCT04060342) [338]. Rational com-\nbination approaches incorporating CD11b agonism with \nother therapeutic modalities, such as chemotherapy, \nmay unlock clinical efficacy not seen with single-agent \napproaches.\nNeutrophil modulation Neutrophils are considered one \nof the main immune cells in the PDAC TME. Increas-\ning research over recent years has revealed the critical \nroles neutrophils play in PDAC tumorigenesis, progres-\nsion, and metastasis, prompting significant attention \nto their study in PDAC [303]. Recent studies have high-\nlighted the importance of polymorphonuclear MDSCs, \na subpopulation of neutrophils with immunosuppressive \nfunctions, in mediating resistance to therapies such as \nCSF-1R blockade in PDAC [339]– [341]. Targeting the \nCXCL8-CXCR1/2 axis has shown promise in preclinical \nPDAC models for neutrophil-targeted therapy [342]. As \ndescribed before, an anti-IL-8 antibody (BMS-986253) \nis currently being tested in the neoadjuvant platform \nclinical trial for resectable PDAC (NCT02451982). Fur-\nther, SX-682, an orally available allosteric inhibitor of \nCXCR1 and CXCR2, is currently being tested in combi-\nnation with nivolumab (NCT04477343) and tislelizumab \n(NCT05604560) in unresectable and resectable PDAC, \nrespectively [343]. Another agent, AZD5069, a selective \nCXCR2 antagonist, is under investigation in combination \nwith durvalumab for metastatic PDAC, though results \nare yet to be reported (NCT02583477).\nAMD3100, a CXCL12/CXCR4 antagonist, has demon-\nstrated promising results in preclinical and clinical stud-\nies. A completed dose-escalation study (NCT02179970) \nin patients with advanced pancreatic cancer showed that \nAMD3100 treatment significantly reduced circulating \ntumor DNA and CXCL8 levels by impairing CXCR4-\nmediated chemokine receptor function, which is cru-\ncial for intratumoral immune cell accumulation [344]. A \nrecently completed phase II clinical trial evaluating the \nsafety and clinical activity of AMD3100 in combination \nwith cemiplimab (PD-1 blockade) in patients with meta-\nstatic pancreatic cancer (NCT04177810) indicated that \nthe combination therapy significantly mobilized myeloid \ncells and increased their infiltration into the hepatic \nmetastatic microenvironment of PDAC, suggesting a"}, {"page_number": 30, "text": "Page 30 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \npotential resistance mechanism to CXCR4-targeted \ntherapy [345]. BL-8040 is a small synthetic peptide that \nbinds to CXCR4 with higher affinity and longer receptor \noccupancy than AMD3100, and has also shown potential \nin clinical studies [346]– [348]. A phase IIa, open-label, \ntwo-cohort study (NCT02826486) assessed the safety, \nefficacy, and immunobiological effects of BL-8040 com-\nbined with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in meta-\nstatic PDAC. The results demonstrated that BL-8040 can \nincrease ­CD8+ effector T cell tumor infiltration, decrease \nMDSCs, and reduce circulating Tregs, suggesting that co-\ninhibition of CXCR4 and PD-1 may enhance chemother-\napy outcomes in PDAC patients [349].\nTargeting stroma  Stromal elements play crucial roles in \ndetermining the biology of PDAC and their response to \nchemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Therefore, design-\ning therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor stroma \nin PDAC is also of paramount importance [158]. Each \nPDAC, due to the physicochemical properties of stromal \nfibrosis, possesses multiple therapeutic obstacles that \nprevent proper vascularization, thereby limiting chemo-\ntherapy exposure and resulting in poor immune cell infil-\ntration [350, 351]. Neuzillet et al. demonstrated through \ntranscriptomic analysis that cancer-associated fibroblasts \n(CAFs) derived from human PDAC exhibit a high level \nof intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity, with at least \nfour subtypes identified [352]. Independent research from \nour institution corroborated these findings, indicating \ninter- and intratumoral heterogeneity in stromal signal-\ning, revealing potential mechanisms for CAF heteroge-\nneity at the transcriptomic level [353]. Approaches to \ndeconstruct the stroma generally involve the use of matrix \nmetalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, hyaluronidase, \nSonic Hedgehog (SHH) inhibitors, fibroblast activation \nprotein (FAP) targeting agents, and focal adhesion kinase \n(FAK) inhibitor.\nDespite preclinical success in other cancers such as \nmelanoma and overall tolerability in patients, MMP \ninhibitors like marimastat and tanomastat failed to dem-\nonstrate significant clinical activity in advanced pan-\ncreatic cancer patients [354, 355]. This suggests that \nnonspecific targeting of the extracellular matrixc (ECM) \nalone is ineffective against pancreatic cancer. A more \nspecific approach to disrupting the ECM’s hardened bar-\nrier is targeting hyaluronic acid. A randomized phase II \ntrial showed that adding PEGPH20, a pegylated recom-\nbinant human hyaluronidase, to gemcitabine/nab-pacli-\ntaxel improved PFS (6.0 vs 5.3 months) in patients with \nuntreated metastatic PDAC [356]. However, another \nphase Ib/II trial indicated that adding PEGPH20 reduced \nOS (7.7 vs 14.4 months) in patients with metastatic PDAC \nreceiving FOLFIRINOX [357]. Additionally, a subsequent \nphase III trial showed that combining PEGPH20 with \ngemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel did not improve OS (11.2 vs \n11.5  months) compared to chemotherapy alone [358]. \nThe inability of PEGPH20 to enhance chemotherapy effi-\ncacy does not necessarily exclude ECM-targeting drugs \nfrom future anti-cancer treatments but suggests that \ntargeting this fibrotic barrier component alone is insuffi-\ncient to explain chemotherapy’s ineffectiveness in PDAC. \nThere is evidence that SHH contributes to both intrinsic \ncellular carcinogenesis and the profibrotic process [359]. \nHence, inhibiting SHH has been explored as a therapeu-\ntic strategy for PDAC. However, clinical trials with SHH \ninhibitors such as saridegib, vismodegib, and vismodegib \nhave been largely disappointing [158].\nElevated activation of FAK signaling potently regu-\nlates the formation of profibrotic stromal matrix depo-\nsition and immunosuppressive TME properties [360]. \nComplementing this understanding, preclinical evidence \nhas provided mechanistic insight demonstrating syn-\nergistic recruitment of anti-tumor effector memory T \nlymphocyte populations following combined targeting \nof prominent oncogenic pathways governing the dense \ndesmoplasia. Namely, concurring disruption of hyalu-\nronic acid-rich stroma and inhibition of CXCR4 recep-\ntor signaling coupled with interdiction of FAK activation \nwithin CAFs successfully reprograms the hostile immune \nenvironment [361]. The current randomized phase II trial \n(NCT03727880) evaluates the use of pembrolizumab \nwith or without Defactinib, a FAK inhibitor, as sequential \nneoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy in patients with high-\nrisk (CA19-9 > 200) resectable PDAC (NCT03727880) \n[362]. The preliminary findings showed that pembroli-\nzumab combined with defactinib was associated with \nlower fibroblast infiltration, higher anti-tumor M1 mac-\nrophage expression and increased ­CD8+ T-cell infiltra-\ntion into the TME, versus pembrolizumab alone. The \nincreased expression of CXCR4 across both treatment \narms may represent a resistance mechanism and sup-\nport CXCR4 as an additional TME target. Furthermore, \npreclinical research has indicated that FAK inhibition \ncan sensitize PDAC to radiotherapy-induced antitumor \nimmunity. The combination of FAK inhibitors with radio-\ntherapy has shown potential in sustaining checkpoint \nimmunotherapy efficacy, leading to prolonged tumor \ncontrol and potential eradication [363]. Based on these \nfindings, a clinical trial (NCT04331041) is currently test-\ning the efficacy of combining FAK inhibition (defactinib) \nwith SBRT in patients with LAPC, although further data \nare still pending.\nIn addition, reprogramming the ECM also involves \ntargeting the cells that deposit ECM components. CAFs \nare the major components of the PDAC stroma and are \nheterogeneous, including myofibroblastic, inflammatory,"}, {"page_number": 31, "text": "Page 31 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \n\t\nand antigen-presenting subtypes [364]. However, the het-\nerogeneity of CAFs makes direct targeting complex and \nmay lead to unexpected biological outcomes, contribut-\ning to the failure of FAP inhibitors [365].\nCell therapy\nTumor‑infiltrating lymphocytes therapy  TILs repre-\nsent a polyclonal population with diverse TCRs capable \nof recognizing a wide array of TAAs, which may offer \nadvantages over genetically engineered immune cells for \ntreating solid tumors [366]. In the immunosuppressive \nenvironment of PDAC, endogenous TILs often lack the \nnecessary quality and quantity to mount a robust antitu-\nmor response. However, ex vivo expansion of TILs from \nsurgically resected pancreatic tumors has demonstrated \nthat these cells can maintain functionality and effectively \ntarget HLA-matched pancreatic tumor cells [367]. Rein-\nfusing this polyclonal TIL product may help overcome \nimmunosuppressive barriers and induce potent tumor \nregression, avoiding the selective pressures associated \nwith single-antigen targeting therapies. The landmark \nC-144–01 trial showed that the autologous TIL prepa-\nration lifileucel achieved an ORR of 31.4%, including 8 \ncomplete responses and 40 partial responses in advanced \nmelanoma patients following the failure of anti-check-\npoint and targeted therapies [368]. Additionally, the \nphase II C-144–01 study results indicated that lifileu-\ncel had clinically meaningful and durable effects in 15 \npatients with the refractory mucosal melanoma subtype \n(ORR: 50%), leading to lifileucel’s recognition as the first \nFDA-approved TIL therapy [369]. In PDAC, research has \nshown that expanded TILs can recognize pancreatic can-\ncer-associated antigens [370]. Current studies are evalu-\nating TIL therapy in advanced PDAC (NCT05098197, \nNCT03935893, NCT03610490, and NCT01174121), with \nresults yet to be published (Table 7) [371]– [373].\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cell therapy  CAR-T \ncell therapy involves isolating and genetically modifying \npatient-derived T lymphocytes ex  vivo to express engi-\nneered CAR constructs on their surface. Antigen selec-\ntion remains a significant challenge for CAR-T strategies \ntargeting PDAC. Most efforts have focused on TAAs, \nwhich often exhibit variable or heterogeneous expression \namong tumor cells, posing a high risk of on-target, off-\ntumor toxicity. Antigens currently under clinical investi-\ngation for CAR-T therapy in PDAC include prostate stem \ncell antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), MUC-\n1, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), \nEGFR, CD133, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and \nClaudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) [374, 375]. Early-phase clinical \ntrials have demonstrated preliminary therapeutic poten-\ntial, but serious adverse events, particularly with HER2 \nand CEA, have limited their evaluation as CAR-T targets \nin PDAC [376]– [379]. Mesothelin, a glycosylphosphati-\ndylinositol-anchored glycoprotein, is overexpressed in \n80–85% of PDAC cases and has low expression in nor-\nmal tissues, making it a promising target antigen [380]. \nIn a phase I clinical trial, six patients with treatment-\nrefractory metastatic PDAC received autologous CAR-T \ncells targeting mesothelin. The treatment was well-toler-\nated, with no cytokine release syndrome or neurological \nadverse events observed, and two patients achieved sta-\nble disease with PFS of 3.8 and 5.4 months, respectively \n[381]. CLDN18.2, a tight junction protein, is ectopically \nexpressed in PDAC and associated precancerous lesions, \nindicating early expression in PDAC development [382]. \nCT041, an autologous T cell therapy genetically modi-\nfied to express a CAR targeting CLDN18.2, was evalu-\nated in a single-arm, open-label, first-in-human phase I \npilot study (NCT03159819) to investigate its safety and \nefficacy. The study demonstrated the safety of CT041 and \nshowed potential therapeutic benefits [383]. In another \nstudy, two patients with metastatic PDAC who received \nCT041 treatment after standard treatment failure both \nachieved a partial response, further supporting the trans-\nlational value of CAR-CLDN18.2 [384]. Further data from \nthe same study, which included an analysis of 24 patients, \ndemonstrated an ORR of 16.7% and a DCR of 70.8%, with \na median OS of 10.0 months, highlighting the potential \nefficacy of CT041 in heavily pretreated pancreatic can-\ncer patients [385]. Currently, another ongoing clinical \ntrial is evaluating CLDN18.2-targeted CAR-T thera-\npies (LB1908) in locally advanced or metastatic PDAC \n(NCT05539430) (Table 7).\nUnlike T cells, NK cells lack clonotypic TCR-CD3 \ncomplexes for signal transduction. Their potent cyto-\ntoxic function is mediated by the release of lytic granules \nand cytokines upon forming an immunological synapse \nwith targets, and they also exhibit memory-like func-\ntions [386, 387]. Recent single-cell analyses have identi-\nfied potentially dysfunctional states in NK cells across \nvarious cancers, similar to T cell exhaustion [388]. In \nPDAC, circulating tumor cells may evade NK surveil-\nlance via the HLA-E:CD94-NKG2A checkpoint [389]. \nAdoptive NK cell therapies genetically engineer CAR \nexpression for tumor-specific targeting [390]. As HLA-\nunrestricted cytotoxic effectors, NK cells offer a universal \nimmunotherapeutic approach without the risk of graft-\nversus-host disease [391]. However, CAR-NK cells also \nface challenges, such as short-lived responses that may \nrequire repeated administrations for sustained efficacy, \ndifficulties in proper antigen selection, antigen hetero-\ngeneity, and donor selection [392]. Importantly, NK cells \nexpress several inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like \nreceptors that interact with their HLA molecule ligands."}, {"page_number": 32, "text": "Page 32 of 59\nWang et al.

Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \nThe widespread expression of HLA molecules on nucle-\nated cells can inhibit CAR-NK cell function [393]. Pre-\nclinical studies have evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy \nof CAR-NK cells targeting prostate stem cell antigen \nand mesothelin in PDAC [394, 395]. A first-of-its-kind, \noff-the-shelf iPSC-derived NK cell therapy, FT500, is \ncurrently under evaluation in a phase I clinical trial for \nadvanced solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer, both \nas a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint \ninhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab), \nIL-2, Cy, and fludarabine (NCT03841110) [396].In addi-\ntion, several ongoing phase I trials are assessing the clini-\ncal application of CAR-NK cells in advanced pancreatic \ncancer, including NKG2D CAR-NK (NCT06478459) and \nCLDN18.2 CAR-NK (NCT06464965) (Table  7) [397, \n398].\nTCR‑engineered T‑cell therapy  TCRs engineered to tar-\nget neoantigen epitopes resulting from somatic mutations \npresent a promising approach in cancer therapy. These \nTCRs can bypass central tolerance mechanisms due to \nthe evasion of negative selection in the thymus, allowing \nfor the identification of high-avidity TCRs with enhanced \nanti-tumor efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity [399, \n400]. In PDAC, the high prevalence and conserved muta-\ntional profile of mKRAS provide a unique opportunity for \ndeveloping neoantigen-directed TCR-T therapies. Spe-\ncifically, HLA-C*08:02-restricted TCRs that recognize \nthe ­KRASG12D mutation have been isolated from TILs of \ncolorectal cancer patients [401]. A case report detailed a \npatient with advanced PDAC harboring a KRAS c.35G > A \n(p.G12D) mutation who received autologous T cells engi-\nneered to express two allogeneic HLA-C*08:02-restricted \nTCRs targeting mutant ­KRASG12D, leading to a partial \nresponse with over 72% regression of visceral metastases \nmaintained for six months. Engineered T cells constituted \nover 2% of circulating T cells thereafter, suggesting the \npotential for sustained therapeutic efficacy [402]. This \ntherapy could benefit any patient with this specific HLA \nallele and tumor-expressing ­KRASG12D mutation, particu-\nlarly when combined with treatments addressing immune \nresistance mechanisms. However, the therapy’s applica-\nbility is limited to patients with the HLA-C*08:02 allele, \nrestricting its potential patient population [403]. Ongoing \nclinical investigations are evaluating mutant ­KRASG12D- \nor ­KRASG12V-specific TCR-transduced T cell therapies \nfor advanced PDAC (NCT03190941, NCT03745326, \nNCT04146298, NCT06218914) (Table 7) [404]. Addition-\nally, a phase I trial is exploring the safety and efficacy of \nautologous mesothelin-specific TCR T cells in metastatic \nPDAC (NCT04809766), representing another avenue for \nTCR-engineered T-cell therapy in this challenging cancer \ntype [405].\nExperimental targeted therapies on the horizon\nPARP inhibitors\nAs previously described, based on the results of the \nPOLO trial, the FDA has approved olaparib for the treat-\nment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic PDAC. \nCurrently, olaparib is being tested in the APOLLO trial, \na randomized phase II study investigating its efficacy \ncompared to placebo in patients with resected pancreatic \ncancer harboring pathogenic BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 \nmutations [406]. However, despite promising results in \nthe POLO trial, approximately 25% of patients experi-\nenced disease progression within 2 months of initiating \nPARP inhibitor treatment, suggesting the development \nof resistance to PARP inhibitors [185]. The mechanisms \nbehind this resistance in pancreatic cancer remain largely \nunclear, highlighting the importance of strategies to \npredict and manage resistance [183]. Researchers are \nexploring various approaches to enhance PARP inhibitor \nefficacy. These include developing new PARP inhibitors \nand combining them with other agents to achieve syner-\ngistic anti-tumor effects. For instance, a phase II single-\narm study evaluated another PARP inhibitor rucaparib as \nmaintenance therapy in 42 patients with advanced pan-\ncreatic cancer with germline or somatic pathogenic vari-\nants in BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2. This study reported \na 6-month PFS rate of 59.5% and an ORR of 41.7%, with \nmedian PFS and OS of 13.1 and 23.5  months, respec-\ntively [407]. Other next-generation PARP inhibitors, \nsuch as fuzuloparib, have been tested in ovarian cancer \n(NCT04517357); however, their application in pancreatic \ncancer has not yet been explored.\nPARP inhibitors have been shown to increase the \nTMB in pancreatic cancer, augment cytoplasmic DNA, \nand potentially activate immunostimulatory pathways \nthrough the release of DAMPs. This has led to the inves-\ntigation of combining PARP inhibitors with ICIs as a \ntherapeutic strategy [408, 409]. A multi-cohort phase \nII trial (NCT04666740) is evaluating the combination \nof pembrolizumab with olaparib (POLAR) as mainte-\nnance therapy for patients with HRD and platinum-sen-\nsitive metastatic PDAC. Preliminary results show that in \nCohort B (patients with platinum-sensitive PDAC with \nnon-core homologous recombination gene mutations, \nsuch as ATM, BAP1, etc.) and Cohort C (platinum-sensi-\ntive patients without known HRD), the combined median \nPFS is approximately 4  months, while median OS has \nincreased to 14 months [410].

The BET protein family plays a critical role in gene \ntranscription, making it an attractive target for cancer \ntherapy [414]. NUV-868 is a novel, highly selective BD2-\nspecific BET inhibitor that, when used in combination \nwith olaparib or androgen receptor antagonist enzaluta-\nmide, has been shown to inhibit tumor xenograft growth \n[415].

This trial, which included 23 patients, \ndemonstrated that this triple therapy was both safe and \neffective in tumors with homologous recombination defi-\nciencies [422]. Another phase I study (NCT02487095) \nassessed M6620 combined with the chemotherapy \ntopotecan, a selective Topo1 inhibitor, in 21 patients \n(including 2 with pancreatic cancer). This combination \nproved to be tolerable and effective [423]. Additionally, \na phase I trial (NCT02157792) evaluated M6620 either \nalone or in combination with carboplatin in 40 patients \nwith advanced solid tumors, including 1 pancreatic can-\ncer, showing good tolerability and antitumor responses \n[424]. A phase I trial (NCT04170153) is ongoing to assess \nanother ATR inhibitor M1774 either as a monotherapy \nor in combination with the PARP inhibitor niraparib \nin patients with advanced solid tumors. Preliminary \nresults indicate that M1774 is well-tolerated [425, 426]. \nAnother phase I/II trial (NCT04497116) is optimizing \nthe regimen for ATR inhibitor camonsertib (RP-3500) \nas monotherapy in advanced solid tumors, includ-\ning 14 pancreatic cancer patients [427]. ATR inhibitors \nunder investigation include AZD6738 (NCT02264678), \nBAY1895344 \n(NCT04267939, \nNCT03188965), \nRP-3500 \n(NCT04972110, \nNCT04497116), \nM4344 \n(NCT04149145), and ATRN-119 (NCT04905914). These \ntrials are exploring the use of these inhibitors as mono-\ntherapy or in combination with chemotherapy and/or \nradiotherapy in advanced solid tumors, including pancre-\natic cancer [418, 428].\nTargeting oncogenic KRAS signaling\nRAS is a subfamily of small GTPases, including KRAS, \nHRAS and NRAS isoforms [429], which act as molecular \nswitches to regulate intracellular signal transduction. \nRAS proteins are activated when bound to guanosine \ntriphosphate (GTP), and inactivated when bound to \nguanosine diphosphate (GDP). When activated, these \nproteins can “switch on” downstream pathways and regu-\nlate cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Their \ngenes have almost the same structure, but in cancer, they \nmutate at different frequencies. KRAS, a major onco-\ngenic driver gene mutated in over 90% of PDAC cases, \nhas revealed new insights into pancreatic carcinogenesis \nand opened opportunities for targeted therapies [430]– \n[432]. The mutations, particularly at codons G12, G13, \nand Q61, result in the constitutive activation of KRAS, \ndriving tumorigenesis through persistent activation of \ndownstream signaling pathways such as RAF/MEK/ERK \nand PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Fig. 3, Table 9) [172, 433, 434].\nAgents directly targeting KRAS mutation  For decades, \ncancer drug development has focused on directly tar-\ngeting RAS function with small molecules and peptides. \nHowever, due to the complex protein structure, high \naffinity for GTP, and multiple alternative signaling path-\nways, the KRAS protein has proven to be an “undrug-\ngable” target [435]. Groundbreaking research in 2013 \nidentified small molecules capable of covalently binding \nto ­KRASG12C-GDP, making KRAS more likely to bind to \nGDP and thus become inactivate [436]. These inhibitors \nspecifically bind to the ­KRASG12C mutant protein, with \nminimal binding affinity for the wild-type KRAS pro-\ntein. Subsequently, a series of ­KRASG12C inhibitors were \ndeveloped, including ARS853 [437], ARS-1260 [438], \nAMG 510 [439], MRTX849 [440], and AMG 510 being \nthe first ­KRASG12C inhibitor to enter clinical develop-\nment. In 2021, the FDA approved the first KRAS-targeted \ndrug, sotorasib (AMG 510), for patients with previously \ntreated NSCLC with ­KRASG12C mutations [441]. The \napproval was based on results from the phase II Code-\nBreaK 100 trial (NCT03600883), which demonstrated an \n80.6% DCR, a median PFS of 6.8 months, and a median \nOS of 12.5 months in patients with ­KRASG12C-mutated \nadvanced NSCLC who had been previously treated with \nstandard therapies [442]. In 2022, the FDA approved the \nsecond ­KRASG12C inhibitor, adagrasib (MRTX849), an oral \nsmall molecule, for the treatment of ­KRASG12C-mutated \nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. This approval \nwas based on the results of the phase II KRYSTAL-1 trial \n(NCT03785249), in which adagrasib achieved an ORR of \n42.9%, a DCR of 79.5%, a median PFS of 6.5 months, and \na median OS of 12.6 months in patients with advanced \nor metastatic NSCLC harboring a ­KRASG12C muta-\ntion [443]. Furthermore, the phase III CodeBreaK 300 \ntrial (NCT05198934) demonstrated a PFS benefit with \ntwo different doses of the ­KRASG12C inhibitor sotorasib"}, {"page_number": 37, "text": "Page 37 of 59\nWang et al.

The KRYSTAL-1 trial (NCT03785249) \nis a multicohort phase I/II study evaluating the ­KRASG12C \ninhibitor adagrasib in patients with advanced solid \ntumors harboring a ­KRASG12C mutation [448]. As of \nFig. 3  Therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer. KRAS, a GTPase, transitions between an inactive GDP-bound state \nand an active GTP-bound state, driving downstream signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR \nand RAF/MEK/ERK pathways. Therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS aim to prevent its activation, disrupt its signaling, or indirectly inhibit the KRAS \npathway upstream. KRAS inhibitors can directly bind to either the GDP-bound or GTP-bound state of KRAS, disrupting further signaling. Specific \ninhibitors for ­KRASG12C (e.g., Sotorasib, Adagrasib) and ­KRASG12D (e.g., MRTX1133, ASP3082) mutations target specific isoforms of mutated KRAS, \nwhile pan-RAS inhibitors (e.g., RMC-6236) offer a broader approach by targeting multiple RAS isoforms. Indirect inhibition of the KRAS pathway \nis being explored through upstream inhibitors, such as SHP2 and SOS1 inhibitors. Downstream inhibitors disrupt key signaling pathways activated \nby KRAS, with examples including PI3K/AKT inhibitors (Rigosertib, Inavolisib), mTOR inhibitors (Everolimus), and RAF/MEK inhibitors (Avutometinib). \nAdditionally, novel KRAS-directed delivery routes, including vaccines targeting specific KRAS mutations (e.g., ELI-002), CAR-T cell therapies, \nand exosomes loaded with siRNA targeting the ­KRASG12D mutation, are also under investigation"}, {"page_number": 38, "text": "Page 38 of 59\nWang et al.

Glecirasib (JAB-\n21822), another highly selective ­KRASG12C inhibitor, \nhas demonstrated promising clinical activity in NSCLC \nand colorectal cancer, and is now being evaluated in \nPDAC with manageable side effects. Two phase I/II tri-\nals (NCT05009329 in China and NCT05002270 in US) \npooled data from 48 patients, including 28 with PDAC. \nAmong these PDAC patients, 13 achieved a partial \nresponse (46.4% ORR), with a DCR of 96.4%, a median \nduration of response of 4.1  months, and a median PFS \nof 5.5 months [449].

Among 24 \npancreatic cancer patients treated, preliminary results \nshowed encouraging antitumor activity and a favorable \nsafety profile, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed; \ndiarrhea was the most common side effect [450]. \nDivarasib (GDC-6036) is another covalent ­KRASG12C \ninhibitor whose safety was evaluated in a phase I study \n(NCT04449874) [451], enrolling 137 patients with a \n­KRASG12C mutations, including those with NSCLC, colo-\nrectal cancer, and other solid tumors. Divarasib showed \ndurable clinical responses with mostly low-grade adverse \nevents. Among the 7 patients with PDAC enrolled, \npartial responses were observed in  3 patients (42.9%), \nand stable disease in 4 patients (57.1%).

The success of ­KRASG12C \ninhibitors has inspired the development of ­KRASG12D \ninhibitors. The ­KRASG12D mutation, found in approxi-\nmately one-third of PDAC patients, has been targeted \nwith MRTX1133, a non-covalent selective inhibitor \ndeveloped through structure-based drug design [453, \n454]. MRTX1133 induced deep tumor regression in \npreclinical ­KRASG12D mouse tumor models and altered \nthe TME, including reduction of MDSCs, increase of \nM1-like macrophages, and increase of tumor-infiltrat-\ning cytotoxic T cells [455]. Given these strong preclini-\ncal data, a phase I trial (NCT05737706) is currently \nenrolling patients to investigate its use in ­KRASG12D \nadvanced solid tumors. However, MRTX1133 has phar-\nmacokinetic issues, and a new formulation is being \ndeveloped [456]. Other ­KRASG12D targeted therapies \nare in earlier phases of drug development, such as \ndirect inhibitor HRS-4642 (NCT05533463), ­KRASG12D \ntargeted degrader ASP3082 (NCT05382559), and \nmolecular glue inhibitor RMC-9805 (NCT06040541) \n(Table 9) [457, 458].\nGiven the heterogeneity of RAS mutations among \npatients, dual or pan-RAS inhibition has emerged as a \npromising therapeutic strategy [459]. RMC-6236 is an \noral small molecule inhibitor designed to target cancers \ndriven by diverse RAS mutations [460]. Preclinical study \non cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models \nof KRAS mutant PDAC demonstrated impressive anti-\ntumor activity [461]. Another study in mouse xenograft \nmodels with ­KRASG12X demonstrated that RMC-6236 \nachieved tumor regressions across multiple tumor types, \nincluding NSCLC and PDAC [462]. An ongoing phase I/\nII clinical trial (NCT05379985) is evaluating the effective-\nness of RMC-6236 in patients with specific RAS mutant \nadvanced solid tumors [462]. As of April 2023, 22 PDAC \npatients with ­KRASG12X were enrolled. Among 10 PDAC \npatients with at least 8  weeks of RMC-6236 treatment, \nobjective response was observed in 2 patients (ORR, \n20%), and DCR was 80%, exhibiting promising anti-\ntumor activity with well tolerance [463]. Notably, to bal-\nance the benefit and toxicity of pan-RAS/KRAS drugs, a \nphase I study combining ­KRASG12C inhibitor RMC-6291 \nwith RMC-6236 (pan-RAS) is now underway in solid \ntumors (NCT06128551). BI-2865 is a novel pan-KRAS \ninhibitor that affects a wide spectrum of mutated KRAS \nand has demonstrated in  vivo tumor reduction capa-\nbility without detrimental effects on the animals [464, \n465]. A phase I trial of BI-3706674, a similar compound \nto BI-2865 that inhibits multiple KRAS variants, is now \nunder investigation in patients with advanced stomach \nand esophagus cancer(NCT06056024) [466]. Addition-\nally, RMC-7977, another promising pan-RAS inhibitor \ntargeting the active state of both mutant and wild-type \nKRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, has exhibited efficacy against \nRAS-dependent tumors with diverse RAS genotypes \nin preclinical models, particularly those harboring the \n­KRASG12X mutation [467].\nAlthough the development of allele-specific inhibi-\ntors has transformed KRAS into a targetable protein, \nresponses occur in only about 20–30% of patients, and \nthese responses are often partial and not durable [468]. \nThus, extensive efforts are underway to overcome intrin-\nsic and acquired drug resistance. Research has shown \nthat drug resistance emerged with MRTX1133 treatment \nin the ­KRASG12D mouse tumor model, characterized by \namplifications of KRAS, Yap1, Myc, and Cdk6/Abcb1a/b, \nand co-evolution of drug-resistant transcriptional pro-\ngrams [469]. Combining MRTX1133 with chemotherapy \nor co-targeting of EGFR may result in better antitumor \neffects than MRTX1133 alone in PDAC mouse models \n[469, 470]."}, {"page_number": 42, "text": "Page 42 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \nTargeting upstream SOS1, SHP2  Inhibiting upstream \neffectors that support KRAS function could target \nall mKRAS alleles indiscriminately, and thus they are \nattractive targets for combination therapies with KRAS \ninhibitors. Son of sevenless 1 (SOS1) triggers GTP load-\ning of KRAS through its nucleotide exchange activity, \nand Src homology region 2-containing protein tyros-\nine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) directly activates SOS1 activ-\nity. Therefore, inhibition of SOS1 or SHP2 could main-\ntain GDP-bound KRAS in an inactive form. A phase I \nclinical trial (NCT04111458) is ongoing in patients with \nKRAS mutated advanced or metastatic solid tumors to \nevaluate the safety and efficacy of the first SOS1 inhibi-\ntor BI-1701963 alone and in combination with the MEK \ninhibitor trametinib [471]. The rationale for adding the \nMEK inhibitor is to eliminate the negative feedback in the \nMEK/ERK signaling pathway caused by SOS1 inhibition. \nThe phase I trial KRYSTAL-14 (NCT04975256) evalu-\nated BI-1701963 in combination with ­KRASG12C inhibitor \nadagrasib in patients with advanced ­KRASG12C mutated \nsolid tumors. Another SOS1 inhibitor MRTX0902 also \nshowed enhanced antitumor activity in combination with \n­KRASG12C inhibitor MRTX849 in mouse xenograft tumor \nmodel [472]. A phase I/II trial (NCT05578092) is ongo-\ning in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancy \nharboring mutations in the KRAS-MAPK pathways \nto evaluate the safety and efficacy of MRTX0902 alone \nand in combination with adagrasib. BI-3406, a selective \nSOS1-KRAS interaction inhibitor, reduced formation \nof GTP-loaded RAS and thus limited cellular prolifera-\ntion of KRAS-driven tumors [473]. BI-3406 also attenu-\nated feedback reactivation induced by MEK inhibitors, \nand is a suitable candidate in combination with MEK \ninhibitors in KRAS-driven tumors. Other SOS1 inhibi-\ntors under development include RM-0331, RMC-5845, \nGH52, and ERAS-9 [474]. SHP2, a tyrosine phosphatase \nactivated by receptor tyrosine kinases, is essential for \nRAS activation [475]. SHP2 inhibitor TNO155 has dem-\nonstrated synergy with ­KRASG12C inhibitor and greatly \nenhanced efficacy against ­KRASG12C tumor cells [476]. \nThe phase I trial (NCT03114319) is ongoing to evaluate \nthe safety and tolerability of TNO155 alone and in com-\nbination with EGFR inhibitor EGF816 (nazartinib) in \npatients with advanced solid tumors. And another phase \nI/II trial (NCT04330664) is ongoing to evaluate TNO155 \nalone and in combination with adagrasib in patients with \n­KRASG12C mutated advanced solid tumors [477]. Trials \nare also underway testing other SHP2 inhibitors combi-\nnations in patients with KRAS-mutated tumors such as \nRMC-4630 (NCT03634982) (Table 9).\nTargeting downstream RAS signaling pathways  Before \nthe development of direct RAS inhibitors, efforts were pri-\nmarily focused on targeting downstream RAS signaling \npathways, such as RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PDK1/AKT/\nmTOR. Given the emergence of primary and acquired \nresistance to KRAS inhibitors, these pathways have gar-\nnered renewed attention. The MEK inhibitor selumetinib \nwas previously compared with gemcitabine as a second-\nline treatment for pancreatic cancer but did not show a \ndifference in OS [478]. Similarly, another MEK inhibitor, \ntrametinib, failed to improve survival when used in com-\nbination with gemcitabine in previously untreated PDAC \n[479]. However, combining MEK inhibitors with other \nagents has shown promise. In vitro studies and patient-\nderived xenograft models have demonstrated that MEK \ninhibition affects a key regulatory axis of autophagy, and \nthat combined inhibition of MEK and autophagy could \nsynergistically suppress PDAC cell proliferation [480, 481]. \nHydroxychloroquine, known for its autophagy inhibitory \nproperties [482], is currently being evaluated in combi-\nnation with various ERK inhibitors, such as LY3214996 \n(NCT04386057), binimetinib (NCT04132505), ulixerti-\nnib (NCT04145297), and trametinib (NCT03825289) in \npancreatic cancer (Table  9). Paradoxically, MEK inhibi-\ntion can induce RAF-MEK complex formation in KRAS \nmutant models through feedback pathways, and disrupt-\ning this loop through multi-node inhibition represents \na promising therapeutic strategy [483]. Avutometinib \n(VS-6766), a novel RAF/MEK clamp, is in phase I trials in \ncombination with adagrasib (NCT05375994) and sotora-\nsib (NCT05074810) for patients with progression on prior \nKRAS-directed treatment, and with chemotherapy and \nthe FAK inhibitor defactinib in PDAC (NCT05669482), \nshowing notable preliminary efficacy [484]. ERK1/2 \ninhibitors have shown limited monotherapy efficacy. In \nthe HERKULES-1 I/IIb trial, 10 pancreatic cancer patients \nreceived the ERK1/2 inhibitor ERAS-007, but of the seven \nevaluable patients, six discontinued treatment within two \nmonths due to disease progression [485]. Interestingly, \nMEK inhibitors are more effective in inhibiting ERK sign-\naling in ­BRAFV600E than in KRAS mutant tumors [483]. \nAn ongoing phase II trial (NCT04390243) is investigat-\ning the combination of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib \nand the MEK inhibitor binimetinib in pancreatic cancer \npatients with a somatic ­BRAFV600E mutation.\nRigosertib is a multi-kinase inhibitor that induces \napoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway. In a \nphase II/III trial, adding rigosertib to gemcitabine for \npreviously untreated PDAC did not demonstrate clini-\ncal benefit compared to gemcitabine alone [486]. The \nongoing phase I trial (NCT04449874) is evaluating the \nKRASG12C inhibitor divarasib, both as a monotherapy \nand in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, \nincluding the PI3K inhibitor inavolisib, in advanced or \nmetastatic ­KRASG12C-mutated solid tumors.

The ongoing KRYSTAL-19 trial (NCT05840510) is \nexploring the combination of adagrasib with nab-siroli-\nmus, a novel albumin-bound mTOR inhibitor, in patients \nwith advanced solid tumors and NSCLC with ­KRASG12C \nmutations.\nOther molecular therapeutic targets\nNRG1 fusions  NRG1 fusions occur in approximately \n0.5% of pancreatic cancers, often presenting in younger \npatients [187]. The most common NRG1 fusion involves \nERBB3/HER3, leading to the overactivation of ERBB3/\nHER3, which drives tumor growth and cancer cell survival. \nSeribantumab, a fully humanized anti-HER3 IgG2 mono-\nclonal antibody, has shown the ability to inhibit tumor \ngrowth in preclinical models driven by NRG1 fusions \n[488]. The phase II CRESTONE trial (NCT04383210) is \ncurrently evaluating seribantumab in patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring NRG1 \nfusions. Preliminary data from this trial suggest that \nseribantumab induces durable responses with a favora-\nble safety profile [489]. Additionally, zenocutuzumab, a \nbispecific antibody targeting NRG1 fusion signaling, has \ndemonstrated promising results in a phase I-II clinical \ntrial (NCT02912949), with an ORR of 40% and a DCR of \n90% in 10 pancreatic cancer patients with NRG1 fusions \n[490].\nClaudin18.2  CLDN18.2 is a tight junction protein \ninvolved in the formation of tight junction complexes, \nmaintaining the barrier function of epithelial cells [382]. \nIt is stably and highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues \nand ectopically expressed in several other tumor types, \nincluding pancreatic, esophageal, and ovarian cancers, \nmaking it a novel target for anti-tumor therapy [491]. \nCurrent therapies targeting CLDN18.2 include mono-\nclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, antibody–drug \nconjugates (ADCs), CAR-T cells, and CAR-NK cells. Zol-\nbetuximab (IMAB362), an anti-CLDN18.2 monoclonal \nantibody, has been evaluated in two randomized phase \nIII trials (SPOTLIGHT and GLOW) to assess its efficacy \nand safety in combination with standard chemotherapy \nfor HER2-negative, CLDN18.2-positive locally advanced \nunresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction adenocarcinoma (GC/GEJA) patients. These tri-\nals demonstrated significantly prolonged OS and PFS with \nzolbetuximab treatment (NCT03504397, NCT03653507) \n[492, 493]. In March 2024, zolbetuximab received its first \napproval in Japan for treating HER2-negative, CLDN18.2-\npositive unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer \n[494]. Notably, CLDN18.2 positivity is reported in nearly \n60% of pancreatic cancer patients [495]. A phase II trial \n(NCT03816163) is currently evaluating zolbetuximab in \ncombination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel as a first-\nline therapy for CLDN18.2-positive metastatic pancreatic \ncancer patients [496]. Another multicenter phase I trial \n(NCT04400383) assessed AB011, a recombinant human-\nized anti- CLDN18.2 monoclonal antibody, as monother-\napy or in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in \npatients with advanced solid tumors, including GC/GEJA \nand pancreatic cancer, showing an ORR of 65.2% with a \nfavorable safety profile [497].\nADC have become an important strategy for tar-\ngeted therapies. CMG901, an CLDN18.2-ADC, showed \nan ORR of 75.0% and a DCR of 100% in a phase Ia trial \n(NCT04805307) for patients with resistant/refrac-\ntory solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer [498]. \nAnother ongoing phase II trial (NCT06219941) is evalu-\nating CMG901 in patients with CLDN18.2-expressing \nadvanced solid tumors, including GC/GEJA and PDAC \n[499]. IBI343, another ADC targeting CLDN18.2, dem-\nonstrated an ORR of 28.0% and a DCR of 80.0% in a \nphase I trial (NCT05458219) involving patients with \nadvanced PDAC or biliary tract cancer, with manageable \nsafety profiles [500].\nCLDN18.2 is also being targeted by bispecific T cell or \nmacrophage engagers. IBI389, an anti-CLDN18.2 bispe-\ncific antibody, showed an ORR of 30.4% and a DCR of \n69.6% in a phase I trial (NCT05164458) with pancreatic \ncancer patients [501]. LB4330, a bi-functional peptide \ntargeting CLDN18.2 with IL-10 expression, is antici-\npated to activate tumor antigen-specific ­CD8+ T cells \nin the TME and is being evaluated in a phase Ib/II trial \n(TRIGGERCD8, NCT06468358) in combination with \nLB1410, a TIM-3/PD-1 bispecific antibody, in patients \nwith advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Additionally, \nPM1032, a CLDN18.2:4-1BB bispecific antibody, is under \nevaluation in a phase I/II trial (NCT05839106) in patients \nwith advanced solid tumors [502]. PT886, a CLDN18.2 \nbispecific antibody that blocks the \"do-not-eat-me\" signal \non macrophages, is also being tested in a phase I/II clini-\ncal trial for pancreatic cancer (NCT05482893) [503]. Fur-\nthermore, as previously described, CLDN18.2-specific \nCAR-T cells or CAR-NK cells are also being explored as \npotential therapies for pancreatic cancers.\nMolecular biomarkers\nWith the advancement of molecular profiling tech-\nnologies, several studies have categorized PDAC into \ndistinct subtypes based on tumor-specific gene expres-\nsion profiles. In 2011, Collisson et  al. delineated three \nPDAC subtypes, classical, quasi-mesenchymal, and \nexocrine-like, through an analysis of transcriptional pro-\nfiles from PDAC samples and cell lines, demonstrating"}, {"page_number": 44, "text": "Page 44 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \ndistinct differences in clinical outcomes and therapeutic \nresponses among these subtypes [504]. In 2015, Moffitt \net al. further refined this classification by identifying two \nprimary tumor subgroups, namely basal-like and classi-\ncal, noting that the basal-like subtype is associated with \nsignificantly poorer survival outcomes but exhibits a bet-\nter response to adjuvant therapy [505]. Building on this, \nmore granular classifications based on Moffitt’s subtypes \nhave been proposed, including “basal-like A”, “basal-like \nB”, “hybrid”, “classical A”, and “classical B” subtypes, to \nbetter distinguish gene expression patterns at various dis-\nease stages [506]. Despite variations in specific genes and \nclassifiers across studies, the basal-like and classical sub-\ntypes are widely supported by most researchers.\nIn the COMPASS trial, whole-genome sequencing \nand RNA sequencing were performed on 195 patients \nwith advanced PDAC treated with mFOLFIRINOX, \ncategorizing 39 as basal-like and 156 as classical. The \nbasal-like subtype was associated with resistance to \nmFOLFIRINOX, reflected in a lower ORR (10% vs 33%) \nand shorter median OS (6.5 vs 10.6  months). GATA6 \nexpression emerged as a prognostic biomarker capable of \ndistinguishing basal-like from classical PDAC [507]. The \nPASS-01 trial is further investigating GATA6 and other \nbiomarkers of first-line chemotherapy response as sec-\nondary endpoints, with results pending [508]. Molecu-\nlar characterization of long-term (over 2  years) versus \nshort-term (less than 3  months) survivors of advanced \nPDAC revealed that short-term survivors were more \nfrequently classified as the basal-like subtype (30% vs \n3%) [509]. Additionally, researchers have developed the \nGemPred transcriptomic signature to predict adjuvant \ngemcitabine sensitivity in PDAC patients [510]. In the \nPRODIGE 24-ACCORD/CCTG PA 6 trial, GemPred-\npositive patients treated with resected PDAC had sig-\nnificantly longer median DFS (27 vs 10  months) and \nOS (68 vs 29  months) compared to GemPred-negative \npatients. However, GemPred did not show predictive \nvalue in the mFOLFIRINOX treatment arm [511]. Rashid \net  al. developed the Purity Independent Subtyping of \nTumors (PurIST) classifier, which accurately differenti-\nates tumor samples into classical and basal-like subtypes, \nand observed that basal-like PDACs are less responsive \nto FOLFIRINOX treatment [512]. The ongoing phase II \nPANCREAS trial (NCT04683315) is evaluating an adap-\ntive neoadjuvant chemotherapy approach guided by Pur-\nIST classification for patients with resectable pancreatic \ncancer and BRPC, with classical subtype patients receiv-\ning mFOLFIRINOX and basal-like subtype patients \nreceiving gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. These studies aim \nto enhance our understanding of the prognostic and \npredictive implications of current therapeutic strate-\ngies in relation to distinct PDAC molecular subtypes. \nOther biomarkers, such as circulating tumor DNA, are \nalso being explored for early detection, surveillance, and \nmonitoring in high-risk PDAC patients (NCT03334708, \nNCT03568630).\nChallenges and future directions\nOver the past decade, extensive preclinical and clinical \nresearch has underscored the pivotal roles of both adap-\ntive and innate immune systems in PDAC immunother-\napy. While ICIs have revolutionized cancer treatment, \ntheir efficacy in pancreatic cancer remains constrained by \nthe immunosuppressive and inaccessible TME. The clini-\ncal benefits of ICIs in pancreatic cancer have been largely \nrestricted to a small subset of patients characterized by \ndMMR, MSI-H, and elevated TMB. The underlying rea-\nsons for the lack of response in the majority of PDAC \npatients to immunotherapy remain elusive. Current con-\nsensus suggests that single-mechanism immunotherapies \nare insufficient to combat pancreatic cancer. Optimizing \nexisting treatment strategies targeting immunosuppres-\nsive TME through rational combinations is believed to \noffer greater benefits.\nRecent biotechnological advances have led to the emer-\ngence of promising new molecules that directly or indi-\nrectly target KRAS. KRAS-directed therapies, including \nsmall molecular inhibitors, TCR-engineered T cells tar-\ngeting KRAS mutations and personalized mRNA vac-\ncines, have shown encouraging results. However, the \nemergence of KRAS-driven resistance mechanisms poses \na significant challenge. Tumors frequently acquire sec-\nondary mutations or activate alternative signaling path-\nways to evade KRAS inhibition, leading to treatment \nfailure [432]. Future clinical research must prioritize \nstrategies to overcome both primary and acquired resist-\nance to KRAS-targeted therapies, such as combining \nKRAS inhibitors with other targeted therapies or immu-\nnomodulators to achieve more durable and effective \nresponses.\nMoreover, with advancements in sequencing technolo-\ngies and multi-omics analyses, there is now an opportu-\nnity to explore the diverse cell lineages within pancreatic \ncancer. Despite the promising research, there remains a \nsignificant challenge in identifying reliable biomarkers \nto predict therapeutic response and toxicity. Biomark-\ners can stratify patients based on their likelihood of \nresponding to specific therapies, enabling personalized \ntreatment approaches. While high-evidence biomarkers, \nsuch as MSI-H, high TMB, and DDR deficiencies, have \nshown promise in predicting ICI response, their applica-\nbility remains limited. Researchers have proposed tumor-\nderived CAFs, microbiomes, and exosomes as potential \nbiomarkers for tracking pancreatic cancer immuno-\ntherapy response [513]. Additionally, recent studies have"}, {"page_number": 45, "text": "Page 45 of 59\nWang et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2024) 17:92 \n\t\nsuggested that a lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio \nmay predict a better response to PD-1 inhibitors in pan-\ncreatic cancer patients [514]. Advances in multi-omics \nanalysis and liquid biopsy technologies have also facili-\ntated the identification of potential biomarkers, such as \ncirculating tumor DNA, immune cell profiles, and spe-\ncific protein expressions, which can predict treatment \nresponse, monitor disease progression, and detect early \nsigns of resistance [515, 516]. Integrating biomarker-\ndriven strategies into clinical practice is crucial for \noptimizing therapeutic efficacy and improving patient \nprognosis in PDAC.\nIn conclusion, the evolving therapeutic landscape is \nfundamentally reshaping our approach to pancreatic can-\ncer treatment. Innovative strategies are being clinically \napplied across various solid tumors, and as more clinical \ndata become available, the use of advanced tools such as \nmachine learning and artificial intelligence will further \nenhance our understanding of pancreatic cancer biology, \nultimately accelerating the development of more promis-\ning new drugs.\nAbbreviations\n5-FU\t\n\u00075-Fluorouracil\nADC\t\n\u0007Antibody–drug conjugate\nATM\t\n\u0007Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated\nATR​\t\n\u0007ATM/Rad3-related\nBET\t\n\u0007Bromodomain and extraterminal\nBRPC\t\n\u0007Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer\nCA19-9\t\n\u0007Carbohydrate antigen 19–9\nCAFs\t\n\u0007Cancer-associated fibroblasts\nCAR​\t\n\u0007Chimeric antigen receptor\nCCR7\t\n\u0007C-X-C chemokine receptor type 7\ncGAS\t\n\u0007Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase\nCLDN18.2\t\n\u0007Claudin18.2\nCpG\t\n\u0007Cytidine-phospho-guanosine\nCSF-1\t\n\u0007Colony-stimulating factor 1\nCSF-1R\t\n\u0007CSF-1 receptor\nCTLA-4\t\n\u0007Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4\nCy\t\n\u0007Cyclophosphamide\nDAMPs\t\n\u0007Damage-associated molecular patterns\nDC\t\n\u0007Dendritic cell\nDCR\t\n\u0007Disease control rate\nDDR\t\n\u0007DNA damage response\nDFS\t\n\u0007Disease-free survival\ndMMR\t\n\u0007Mismatch repair deficiency\nEGFR\t\n\u0007Epidermal growth factor receptor\nEORTC​\t\n\u0007European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer\nFAK\t\n\u0007Focal adhesion kinase\nFAP\t\n\u0007Fibroblast activation protein\nFF\t\n\u0007Folinic acid and fluorouracil\ngBRCAm\t\n\u0007Germline BRCA-mutated\nGC/GEJA\t\n\u0007Gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma\nGITSG\t\n\u0007Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group\nGDP\t\n\u0007Guanosine diphosphate\nGM-CSF\t\n\u0007Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor\nGTP\t\n\u0007Guanosine triphosphate\nHER2\t\n\u0007Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\nHRR\t\n\u0007Homologous recombination repair\nICIs\t\n\u0007Immune checkpoint inhibitors\nIFN\t\n\u0007Interferon\niHD-SBRT\t\n\u0007Isotoxic high-dose stereotactic body radiation\nIL\t\n\u0007Interleukin\nIMRT\t\n\u0007Intensity modulated radiation therapy\nLAG-3\t\n\u0007Lymphocyte activation gene-3\nLAPC\t\n\u0007Locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer\nLPD\t\n\u0007Laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy\nMDSCs\t\n\u0007Myeloid-derived suppressor cells\nmKRAS\t\n\u0007Mutant KRAS\nMMP\t\n\u0007Matrix metalloproteinase\nMMR-p\t\n\u0007MMR-proficient\nMSI-H\t\n\u0007Microsatellite instability-high\nMUC-1\t\n\u0007Mucin-1\nNSCLC\t\n\u0007Non-small cell lung cancer\nOFF\t\n\u0007Oxaliplatin plus folinic acid and fluorouracil\nOPD\t\n\u0007Open pancreatoduodenectomy\nORR\t\n\u0007Objective response rate\nOS\t\n\u0007Overall survival\nPARP\t\n\u0007Poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase\nPD-1\t\n\u0007Programmed death-1\nPDAC\t\n\u0007Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\nPD-L1\t\n\u0007Programmed death-ligand 1\nPFS\t\n\u0007Progression-free survival\npoly-IC\t\n\u0007Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid\nPRRs\t\n\u0007Pattern recognition receptors\nRCTs\t\n\u0007Randomized clinical trials\nRPD\t\n\u0007Robotic pancreatoduodenectomy\nRTOG\t\n\u0007Radiation therapy oncology group\nSBRT\t\n\u0007Stereotactic body radiation\nSHH\t\n\u0007Sonic Hedgehog\nSHP2\t\n\u0007Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase \n2\nSOS1\t\n\u0007Son of sevenless 1\nSTING\t\n\u0007Stimulator of interferon genes\nTAAs\t\n\u0007Tumor-associated antigens\nTAMs\t\n\u0007Tumor-associated macrophages\nTANs\t\n\u0007Tumor-associated neutrophils\nTCR​\t\n\u0007T cell receptor\nTIGIT\t\n\u0007T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains\nTILs\t\n\u0007Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes\nTIM-3\t\n\u0007T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3\nTLR\t\n\u0007Toll-like receptor\nTMB\t\n\u0007Tumor mutation burden\nTME\t\n\u0007Tumor microenvironment\nTreg\t\n\u0007Regulatory T cell\nWT1\t\n\u0007Wilms tumor 1\nAuthor contributions\nJunke Wang, and Jie Yang contributed equally to this project.

However, the instability of\nnucleic acid-based drugs in vivo and the avascularity of pancreatic cancer with dense stroma have limited their application.\nFortunately, VNP20009, a genetically modiﬁed strain of Salmonella typhimurium, which has a preference for anaerobic\nenvironments, but is toxic and lacks speciﬁcity, can potentially serve as a delivery vehicle for ApDC. Here, we propose a synergistic\ntherapy approach that combines the penetrative capability of bacteria with the targeting and toxic effects of ApDC by conjugating\nApDC to VNP20009 through straightforward, one-step click chemistry. With this strategy, bacteria speciﬁcally target pancreatic\ncancer through anaerobic chemotaxis and subsequently adhere to tumor cells driven by the aptamer’s speciﬁc binding. Results\nindicate that this method prolongs the serum stability of ApDC up to 48 h and resulted in increased drug concentration at tumor\nsites compared to the free drugs group. Moreover, the aptamer’s targeted binding to cancer cells tripled bacterial colonization at\nthe tumor site, leading to increased death of tumor cells and T cell inﬁltration. Notably, by integrating chemotherapy and\nimmunotherapy, the effectiveness of the treatment is signiﬁcantly enhanced, showing consistent results across various animal\nmodels. Overall, this strategy takes advantage of bacteria and ApDC and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for\npancreatic cancer treatment.\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy  (2024) 9:272 \n; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01973-3\nINTRODUCTION\nPancreatic cancer, predominantly pancreatic ductal adenocarci-\nnoma (PDAC), is characterized by a high mortality rate. Notably,\n80–85% of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages or have\nalready experienced metastasis, eliminating the possibility of\nsurgery.1\nThe\nprimary\nclinical\ntreatment\nfor\nunresectable,\nmetastatic\nadvanced\npancreatic\ncancer\nis\nchemotherapy.2\nHowever, chemotherapy carries signiﬁcant toxicity and has\nlimited efﬁcacy in improving patient survival. In a phase III\nclinical trial of advanced pancreatic cancer patients receiving\nFOLFIRINOX treatment, the median overall survival for the\nFOLFIRINOX group was 11.1 months,3 while the gemcitabine\ngroup had a median survival of 6.8 months.4 In recent years, we\nhave\nwitnessed\ncontinuous\nresearch\nendeavors\naimed\nat\ndeveloping novel treatment strategies and combinations to\nimprove\noutcomes\nfor\npancreatic\ncancer\npatients.\nThese\ntherapies include PARP inhibitors, drugs targeting certain KRAS\nmutations, and TRK inhibitors.5 Unfortunately, PARP inhibitors,\nmainly used for treating tumors with DDR deﬁciencies, along\nwith drugs targeting certain KRAS mutations and TRK inhibitors,\nare not effective for all patients.6 Immunotherapy, which has\nshown promise in various cancers,7 is currently effective only in\na small subset of PDAC patients with deﬁcient mismatch repair\n(dMMR) and/or high microsatellite instability (MSI-H).8 Overall,\ndespite considerable efforts, the death rate among pancreatic\ncancer patients is still elevated, with a 5-year survival rate under\n10%.9\nThe unique microenvironment of pancreatic cancer presents\nadditional challenges in its treatment. Approximately 70% of\npancreatic cancer patients exhibit a “dense” tumor microenviron-\nment, characterized by a high concentration of dense connective\ntissue and extracellular matrix. This not only hampers effective\ndrug\ndelivery\nbut\nmay\nalso\nweaken\nthe\neffectiveness\nof\nchemotherapy and other treatment modalities. This microenvir-\nonmental feature renders pancreatic cancer a difﬁcult-to-treat\ncancer type, and new drugs or new strategies that can overcome\nthis limitation are urgently needed.\nAptamers, composed of short single-stranded DNA or RNA\nmolecules, represent a compelling alternative. These molecules\ncan be either selected or meticulously designed to exhibit potent\nafﬁnity and speciﬁcity for particular target molecules, such as\ndisease-associated proteins or cell surface receptors.10 Aptamers\noffer a broad spectrum of advantages, including ease of synthesis\nand customization, thermal stability, diminutive molecular size,\nand robust tissue penetration capabilities.11 These attributes\nrender\naptamers\npromising candidates\nfor the\ndelivery\nof\ntherapeutic agents.

This progress has led to the development of aptamer-\ndrug conjugates (ApDC), innovative constructs that skillfully\ncombine the targeting accuracy of aptamers with the therapeutic\neffectiveness of drug payloads. One such payload is Monomethyl\nAuristatin E (MMAE), a tubulin inhibitor that disrupts microtubule\ndynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and\nsubsequent apoptosis.14 The application of MMAE in constructing\nApDCs (Aptamer-drug conjugates) has shown promise in targeted\ncancer therapy.15 However, it should be noted that nucleic acid\naptamers have some drawbacks, such as the risk of renal\nclearance.16 and degradation by nucleases in vivo.17 This may\nculminate in premature drug exposure and unintended toxic\nconsequences.18 Recent studies indicate that modifying nucleic\nacid aptamers or strategically conjugating them with microorgan-\nisms can signiﬁcantly prolong their presence in the body and\nreduce their vulnerability to renal clearance.19,20 However, the\nbiosafety of organisms needs to be considered.\nVNP20009, characterized as an attenuated strain of Salmonella,\nexhibits a unique cell membrane-penetrating ability and the\nfurther capacity to navigate the “dense” stroma of the pancreas in\naddition to a distinct preference for anaerobic environments.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated its ability to induce apoptosis\nand necrosis in tumor cells,21 while concurrently galvanizing the\nhost’s immune system to mount a robust response, thereby\neffectively hindering tumor growth.22 However, Phase I clinical\ntrials that utilized these bacteria as standalone treatments for\ntumors have not yielded substantial tumor regression, revealing a\ncritical limitation: insufﬁcient toxicity and targeting effect.23\nIncreasingly evidence suggests that bacterial therapy could be\nsynergistically combined with other treatment modalities; mean-\nwhile, the outstanding penetration noted above and biosafety\nmake bacteria an intriguing candidate for nucleic acid-based drug\ndelivery in the realm of solid tumor therapy.24\nTo overcome the signiﬁcant challenges in pancreatic cancer\ntreatment, we propose a novel synergistic therapy that harnesses\nthe mutual beneﬁts of bacteria and aptamer-drug conjugates\n(ApDC). Using a simple and direct “click chemistry” approach, we\ncovalently attach ApDC to the surface of VNP20009. This\ninnovative strategy leverages the mutual advantages of both\ncomponents: ApDC enhances bacterial colonization within the\ntumor microenvironment (TME), while VNP signiﬁcantly improves\nthe stability of ApDC and assists in its effective penetration of the\ndense tumor stroma. This reciprocal relationship ensures that the\ntherapeutic agent reaches the tumor more effectively and remains\nstable, leading to optimized drug delivery, enhanced therapeutic\nefﬁcacy, and activation of a targeted immune response. This dual-\nfunctional approach offers a promising new direction for the\ntreatment of pancreatic cancer.\nRESULTS\nConstruction and characterization of Sgc8c-MMAE-anchored\nVNP20009\nTo validate PTK7 as a target in pancreatic cancer, we conducted\nsurvival analysis, comparative expression studies using The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA) data, and immunohistochemical (IHC)\nstaining. IHC showed high PTK7 expression in pancreatic cancer\ntissues\nacross\ndifferent\nstages\n(Supplementary\nFig.\n1a,\nb).\nKaplan–Meier curves indicated that higher PTK7 expression\ncorrelates\nwith\npoorer\ndisease-free\nsurvival\n(Supplementary\nFig. 1c, d). Comparative analysis revealed signiﬁcantly higher\nPTK7 levels in cancerous versus non-tumor tissues (Supplementary\nFig. 1e). These results conﬁrm PTK7’s high expression in pancreatic\ncancer, supporting its potential for targeted therapy.\nLeveraging click chemistry’s efﬁciency for inert bond forma-\ntion,25 we introduced Azido-D-alanine (–N3) into bacterial growth\nmedium, leading to its integration into the bacterial cell wall and\nthe presentation of azide groups (VNP–N3). To facilitate the\nconjugation process, we utilized Dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO), a\nbiocompatible linker commonly used in click chemistry for\nconjugating biomolecules. We then conjugated aptamer DBCO-\nSgc8c to the drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), following our\nestablished protocol,26 and subsequently conﬁrmed the product\nDBCO-Sgc8c-MMAE by mass spectrometry (MS) (Supplementary\nFig. 2). We observed that incubation of azide-modiﬁed bacteria\nwith DBCO-modiﬁed Sgc8c-MMAE at 37 °C for 4 h facilitated a\ncopper-free click reaction, resulting in the construction of\nfunctionalized (i.e., drug-loaded) bacteria (VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE).\nFor visualization purposes, the Sgc8c-MMAE component was\ntagged with a Cy5 ﬂuorescent probe, enabling the tracking of its\nco-localization with inherently GFP-expressing VNP20009 bacteria\n(VNPGFP) via laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Notably,\nboth unmodiﬁed Sgc8c aptamer and its drug-conjugated variant,\nSgc8c-MMAE, effectively bound to the VNP20009 bacterial surface\n(Fig. 1a). To exclude the probability of non-speciﬁc adsorption of\nnucleic acid to the VNP surface, we mixed VNP lacking N3 with\nSgc8c-MMAE. LSCM results showed that there was no Cy5\nﬂuorescence signal on the bacterial surface, conﬁrming the\nconjugation via the “click” reaction. This binding was further\ncorroborated by ﬂow cytometry analysis, which demonstrated a\nmarked increase in Cy5 ﬂuorescence intensity on the functiona-\nlized bacteria (Fig. 1b). Additionally, the rise in Zeta-potential of\nfunctionalized bacteria indicated interaction with negatively\ncharged ApDC, afﬁrming the conjugation’s efﬁcacy (Fig. 1c).\nTogether, these results validate the efﬁcacy and reliability of using\nclick chemistry for conjugating ApDC to bacteria.\nTo quantify the number of aptamers anchored onto each\nbacterium, ﬂuorescence spectrophotometric measurements were\nconducted on VNP20009 conjugated with Cy5-labeled Sgc8c-\nMMAE. As delineated in Supplementary Fig. 2a–c, we deduced the\ndensity of surface-bound Sgc8c-MMAE to be ~2.5 nmol of ApDC\nper 108 CFU bacteria, equating to around 1.5 × 107 Sgc8c-MMAE\nper VNP20009. Notably, this click chemistry-based nucleic acid-\nbacteria conjugation method displayed a yield that is 27-fold\nsuperior to the amide reaction previously documented in the\nliterature.19\nThe stability of ApDC is crucial for in vivo applications\nTo assess the stability of aptamer on bacteria, we monitored the\nﬂuorescence intensity of Cy5-labeled Sgc8c-MMAE on bacteria\nafter incubation with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS at 37 °C\nfor different time point (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Compared to our\nprior ﬁndings reporting that over 60% of free ApDC degraded\nwithin\n12 h18\nthe\nbacterial\nsurface-grafted\nApDC\nexhibited\nenhanced stability, retaining over 60% of the aptamers intact\nafter 48 h (Fig. 1d). We suspect that attaching ApDC onto the\nsurface\nof\nbacteria\ncould\nsigniﬁcantly\nenhance\nthe\nsteric\nhindrance, thereby reducing the nucleolytic degradation of ApDC.\nTo determine whether ApDC conjugation or preparation\nmethod\ninﬂuenced\nVNP20009\ngrowth,\nboth\nunmodiﬁed\nVNP20009 and VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE were cultured in 100% LB\nculture medium for 12 h. The bacterial counts of both groups\nwere determined using the plate count method, and growth\nkinetics within 12 h were monitored via optical density measure-\nments at 600 nm. The results suggested a negligible impact on\nbacterial growth. (Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Fig. 2e). This\ncorresponds to the understanding that the drug MMAE, as a\nmitosis inhibitor, primarily affects eukaryotic cells.27 Bacteria are\nprokaryotic organisms and undergo binary ﬁssion rather than\nmitosis, MMAE is unlikely to have the same direct inhibitory effect\non bacteria.28\nAptamer-drug conjugates-loaded bacteria for pancreatic cancer synergistic. . .\nXiao et al.\n2\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy  (2024) 9:272"}, {"page_number": 3, "text": "Fig. 1\nConstruction of functionalized VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE. a Laser scanning confocal microscopy images of VNP@Sgc8c, VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE and\nVNP+Sgc8c-MMAE.

Studies have shown that PTK7 is\noverexpressed in several types of cancers, including pancreatic\ncancer,12 as demonstrated in our ﬂow cytometry results (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 3a). To validate the speciﬁc binding of Sgc8c to\npancreatic cancer, we utilized a random oligonucleotide library with\nthe same number of bases as a control (Lib) and tested binding\nafﬁnity with three different pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1,\nMiapaca-2 and KPC1199). Cells were incubated with Cy5-labeled Lib,\nSgc8c, or Sgc8c-MMAE on ice for 30 min, and ﬂow cytometry results\nhighlighted modest PTK7 expression in speciﬁc pancreatic cancer\nsubsets (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Both native Sgc8c and its drug-\nconjugated version, Sgc8c-MMAE, exhibited prominent binding to\npancreatic cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Additionally, LSCM\nresults indicated that Sgc8c effectively bound to all three pancreatic\ncancer cell lines and that its binding afﬁnity was not compromised\nby MMAE conjugation (Supplementary Fig. 3c).\nTo further test whether VNP conjugation would inﬂuence the\ntargeting effect of Sgc8c, LSCM was performed. Following a 2-h\ncoincubation with VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE and naive VNP20009, LSCM\nvisualization revealed an increased bacterial association with the\nMiapaca-2 cells, underscoring the contributory role of Sgc8c-\nMMAE (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4).\nThe synergistic cytotoxicity of VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE on pancreatic\ncancer cells was studied with the Yopro-PI assay (Fig. 2b). Results\nindicated only negligible cytotoxicity from standalone VNP20009.\nIn contrast, VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE, beneﬁting from both targeting\ntoxicity of ApDC and its intrinsic antitumor potency, triggered\n20–60% cell death (necrosis and apoptosis) at the corresponding\nbacterial concentrations (Fig. 2b, c). The differences in cell death\namong the three pancreatic cancer cell lines may be attributed to\nPTK7 protein levels, with lower PTK7 on KPC1199 cells leading to\nreduced uptake of VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE and consequently lower\ncytotoxic effects, which is in line with the results in Supplementary\nFig. 3d–f and Supplementary Fig. 4c.\nSimultaneously, a collaborative synergy was observed between\nbacteria and drug. With the concentration of MMAE maintained at\n64 nM, the standalone drug, Sgc8c-MMAE, triggered roughly 10%\ncell apoptosis and necrosis. On the other hand, the VNP@Sgc8c-\nMMAE group caused about 2–8 times more cell death compared to\nthe Sgc8c-MMAE group among the three cell lines. Cytotoxicity of\nVNP@Sgc8c-MMAE was further explored with the CCK-8 assay,\nwhich evaluated the inﬂuence of different drug concentrations on\nthe viability of pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, the VNP@Sgc8c-\nMMAE group demonstrated a markedly heightened cytotoxicity,\nwhich was dose-dependent, compared to the other groups (Fig. 2d).\nThe efﬁciency of bacterial penetration was also conﬁrmed in a\nMiapaca-2 tumor xenograft model, followed by intravenous injection\nof PBS or 1 × 107 CFU of GFP-expressing VNP20009 or VNP@ApDC.\nTumor tissues were collected and sections were prepared for\nﬂuorescence microscopy study. ApDC increased the colonization of\nVNP20009 at the tumor site, resulting in a corresponding increase in\nthe quantity of VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE inside the tissue in comparison to\nother control groups (Supplementary Fig. 5).\nIn summary, VNP@ApDC maintained its aptamer-targeting\neffect, drug cytotoxicity, and bacterial penetration to ensure its\nin vivo application.\nApDC-assisted bacteria efﬁciently colonize in vivo\nTo verify application potential, bacteria were tracked in vivo. To\naccomplish this, VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE, engineered with the Lux-\nCDABE cluster, was intravenously injected to Miapaca-2 tumor-\nbearing mice, alongside controls Lux-engineered VNP20009 and\nVNP@Lib-MMAE. In vivo imaging results showed increasing\nluminescence\nat\ntumor\nlocations\nfrom\n24\nto\n72 h,\nand\nVNP@Sgc8c-MMAE displayed a threefold higher signal than\ncontrols at 72 h (Fig. 3a, b). While controls indicated accumulation\nin multiple organs, the tumor-speciﬁc localization of VNP@Sgc8c-\nMMAE suggests the effect of speciﬁc aptamer-targeting to\npancreatic cancer. Comparable outcomes were also observed in\nthe ex vivo results (Supplementary Fig. 6a–d).\nTo elucidate the biodistribution of bacteria, we conducted ex\nvivo imaging of organs from an additional 9 mice. Heart, kidney,\nliver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues were collected from mice and\nhomogenized, and the homogenate was coated on LB agar for\nbacterial proliferation, and the number of bacteria was counted. At\n24 h, bacteria had mainly colonized in the liver and spleen, but\neliminated within 48 h (Fig. 3c–i). Given the preference of bacteria\nfor the hypoxic TME and the speciﬁc binding of Sgc8c to pancreatic\ncancer cells, nearly 90% VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE colonized the tumor at\n72 h. Meanwhile, unmodiﬁed VNP or VNP@Lib-MMAE showed\nsome presence in the liver, kidneys, and spleen, but the signal\nintensity was lower than that of the VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE group. This\nindicates that the conjugation of Sgc8c-MMAE to VNP does not\ncompromise the bacteria’s innate targeting ability. Instead, it\nenhances their speciﬁc localization at PTK7-overexpressing tumor\ntissues. Additionally, the luminescence signal of VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE\nat tumor sites was 4–5 times brighter than that of the VNP group at\n72 h (Fig. 3d–f), according to the in vivo results.\nTo further investigate the in vivo stability of ApDC, we used\nluminescence and ﬂuorescence imaging in immune-competent\nKPC1199 tumor-bearing C57 mice to colocalize ApDC with VNP\n(Supplementary Fig. 6e). The results indicated that the majority of\nCy5-labeled ApDC signals remained in the tumor region after 72 h,\ndemonstrating signiﬁcant stability and accumulation at the tumor\nsite (Supplementary Fig. 6f, i). The VNP carrier notably enhanced\nApDC stability, maintaining its presence in the tumor area longer\ncompared to unmodiﬁed nucleic acid drugs, which typically have\na short half-life in vivo.29\nFurthermore, Supplementary Fig. 6g, h shows that VNP@Sgc8c-\nMMAE exhibited higher stability and accumulation than other\ngroups. The ApDC facilitated bacterial colonization at the tumor\nsite, while the bacteria enhanced ApDC accumulation in the\ntumor, addressing the suitability and efﬁcacy of the VNP@Sgc8c-\nMMAE combination.\nBacteria-assisted deep penetration of ApDC in tumor\nPancreatic cancer possesses a dense, intricate microenvironment.30\nthat obstructs drug and immune cell penetration, thereby limiting the\nefﬁcacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.31 Prior research\nsuggests that VNP20009 can navigate through the defenses of\npancreatic tumors to penetrate deeply,32 which has been proved in\nan\nMiapaca-2-bearing\nCDX\nmodel.\nThe\npenetrative\neffect\nof\nVNP@Sgc8c-MMAE was further conﬁrmed in KPC1199 subcutaneous\nmouse model (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 7), Patient-Derived\nXenograft (PDX) mouse model (Supplementary Fig. 8) and in-situ\ncarcinoma model (Supplementary Fig. 9), each administered with\nSgc8c-MMAE or VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE. Tumor tissues were extracted 24\nor 48 h later, and the co-localization effect of VNPGFP and Cy5-Sgc8c-\nMMAE was observed. Figure 4a illustrates how bacteria (green) ferry\nthe drug (red) deeper into the tumor over time, while the individual\ndrug, Sgc8c-MMAE, lingers at the tumor’s periphery 48 h post-\ninjection. The quantiﬁcation of ﬂuorescence intensity distribution\nrevealed distinct patterns of drug and bacterial localization within\ntumor spheroids.\nFor the VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE group, Fig. 4b shows that a subset of\nbacteria and drugs colocalized at a signiﬁcant distance, ~1000 μm\nfrom the tumor’s edge. In contrast, the distribution of the drug\nalone, Sgc8c-MMAE, was predominantly conﬁned to a region\nwithin 30 μm of the tumor’s edge (Supplementary Fig. 7). These\nobservations collectively suggest a role for bacteria as a vector for\ndeep tumor penetration by therapeutic agents. This may be\nattributed to the bacteria’s innate ﬂagellar motility, which allows\nnavigation through tissues unaffected by ﬂuid dynamics or\nhydrodynamic forces.33\nAptamer-drug conjugates-loaded bacteria for pancreatic cancer synergistic. . .\nXiao et al.\n4\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy  (2024) 9:272"}, {"page_number": 5, "text": "Fig. 2\nTargeting effect and cytotoxicity of functionalized VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE to pancreatic cancer cell lines. a LSCM images of Miapaca-2\npancreatic cancer cells incubated with 107 CFU VNP20009 or VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE for 2 h at 37 °C.

Additionally, there was a marked reduction in myoﬁ-\nbroblastic CAFs (myoCAFs), which typically impede immune cell\ninﬁltration by remodeling the extracellular matrix and promoting\nﬁbrosis. This reduction likely facilitated the increased inﬁltration of\nimmune cells. These ﬁndings suggest that VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE\nboosts antitumor immunity not only by increasing cytotoxic and\nhelper T cell populations but also by potentially modifying the\ntumor stroma to alleviate barriers to immune cell inﬁltration,\nhighlighting its potential as a powerful immunotherapeutic\nstrategy (Supplementary Fig. 11).\nThese ﬁndings, in alignment with the results of bacterial\ncolonization and ApDC penetration conﬁrm the synergistic effect\nof the bacteria-ApDC complex in these models.\nIn vivo synergistic therapy efﬁcacy of VNP@ApDC\nTo assess the efﬁcacy of in vivo synergistic therapy in bacteria-\nassisted drug delivery, we ﬁrst established a subcutaneous\npancreatic tumor model with KPC1199 cells. Mice were divided\ninto six groups (PBS, Sgc8c-MMAE, VNP, VNP+Sgc8c-MMAE,\nVNP@Lib-MMAE and VNP@Sgc8-MMAE, n = 8), and each group\nreceived\nintravenous\ninjections\nof\nbacterial\nconcentrations\n(107 CFU) and drug dosages (0.25 nmol). Results revealed that\nVNP-containing formulations consistently impeded tumor pro-\ngression (Fig. 5a–d). Particularly, the VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE group\ndisplayed superior antitumor activity compared to controls. Body\nweight tracking indicated negligible affection on mouse health\nwith different treatment at the given dosages (Fig. 5b).\nTo\nfurther\nexplore\nthe\nimmune\nreaction\ntriggered\nby\nVNP@ApDC, T-cell activation was analyzed. A single-cell suspension\nwas ﬁrst prepared from tumor tissues post-treatment and studied\nwith ﬂow cytometry. With VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE treatment, results\nshow a signiﬁcant increase of CD3+ CD4+ T cells in the VNP group\nand the combined VNP@ApDC group. In contrast, no notable T-cell\ninﬁltration was found in either the PBS or Sgc8c-MMAE groups\n(Fig. 5e, f and Supplementary Fig. 12). Cytokines are always\nsecreted upon T cell activation, so to further assess the synergistic\ntherapy of VNP@ApDC, ELISA was performed to test the level of\ninterferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Results\nrevealed that the level of both was elevated in plasma and tumor\ntissues (Fig. 5g), suggesting that VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE treatment had\nactivated a heightened antitumor immune response compared to\nbacteria and ApDC.\nAdditionally, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was carried\nout to monitor tissue necrosis (Supplementary Fig. 13). Results\nrevealed signiﬁcant necrosis in tumor tissues after treatment with\nthe VNP@ApDC. Ki67 staining underscored the marked inhibitory\neffect of VNP@ApDC on tumor cell proliferation. TUNEL assay\nhighlighted that the VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE group induced the most\npronounced cancer cell death (Supplementary Fig. 14).\nTo further clarify the antitumor effect of bacteria-facilitated\nApDC, a PDX model was utilized. Once tumors grew to a volume\nof around 100 mm3, mice were subjected to different therapeutic\nregimens, as depicted in Fig. 6a. Even in nude mice with a\ndiminished immune response, results show a marked therapeutic\nadvantage favoring\nthe VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE\ngroup\nover\nthe\nisolated Sgc8c-MMAE group (Fig. 6b–e and Supplementary Fig.\n15). This differential outcome may hinge on the propensity of\nbacteria for the hypoxic TME. Notably, pancreatic tumors are often\ncharacterized by compromised blood perfusion, posing challenges\nfor effective drug delivery to the tumor locus.36,37 In this context,\nbacteria can ferry a larger cache of ApDC into the tumor’s oxygen-\ndeprived zones, thereby bolstering drug density within the tumor\nmilieu. IHC assessments (Fig. 6f) vividly demonstrate that the\nVNP@ApDC group, relative to other groups, induced heightened\ncell death and decisive inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.\nIt is noteworthy that regressive tumor effect in the PDX model\nwas more pronounced than that in the C57 subcutaneous tumor\nmodel constructed using KPC1199 cells. A possible explanation is\nthe rapid growth of murine-derived KPC1199 cells, while the PDX\nmodel exhibits slower tumor progression.\nTo more closely emulate clinical scenarios of tumor develop-\nment, progression, and therapeutic intervention, we initiated an\nin-situ carcinoma model of pancreatic cancer.38 The experiment\nentailed the implantation of the luciferase-expressing KPC1199\ncell line into the pancreatic tissue of male C57 mice, as delineated\nin Fig. 7a. Tumor growth was analyzed by monitoring the\nbioluminescence signal. Results showed that the VNP@Sgc8c-\nMMAE group, which utilized bacteria-mediated drug delivery,\ndemonstrated signiﬁcant antitumor effects, as indicated by the\nreduced tumor size as shown in Fig. 7b–d.\nTumors in this group were substantially smaller, weighing only\n30 to 35% of those in the Sgc8c-MMAE group and about half the\nsize of those in other control groups (Fig. 7e). Notably, weight\nproﬁles and survival curve of the treated mice suggested no\nadverse effects (Fig. 7f–h). Additionally, the IFN-γ and TNF-α\nproﬁles suggest that VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE not only triggers a strong\ninnate immune response but also enhances adaptive immunity\nthrough the induction of Th1-type cytokines (Fig. 7i, j). Speciﬁcally,\nas shown in Fig. 7k, higher CCL5 levels in the VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE\ngroup indicate its role in recruiting T cells to the tumor site,\nthereby enhancing the immune response and creating a more\nfavorable environment for immunotherapy.\nTo assess the immune response elicited by VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE,\ntumor tissues from treated mice were processed into single-cell\nsuspensions and analyzed via ﬂow cytometry. The analysis\nincluded CD45+ immune cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, dendritic\ncells, neutrophils, and M1 and M2 macrophages. Functional\nmarkers such as T-bet, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and granzyme B (GzmB) were\nalso measured.

Here, the natural inclination of bacteria towards hypoxic\nenvironments, which are characteristic of tumor sites, is leveraged\nto ensure the direct transport of ApDC to the tumor. This results in\na more focused and potent therapeutic impact, crucial for a\ndisease where traditional delivery methods frequently fall short.\nA critical innovation in this study is the synergy created\nbetween the aptamer component and bacterial colonization.\nSurface markers for PDAC cells are selected using databases like\nTCGA and validated with tissue microarrays, while high-afﬁnity\naptamers are identiﬁed through SELEX technology. The aptamer’s\nspeciﬁc afﬁnity for cancer cells not only aids in targeting the tumor\nwith precision but also enhances bacterial colonization at the\ntumor site. This dual-targeting mechanism is likely to substantially\nimprove the treatment’s efﬁcacy by ensuring a higher concentra-\ntion of therapeutic agents directly where they are most needed.\nThe mechanism of tumor cell destruction and subsequent\nimmune activation outlined in this study is particularly note-\nworthy. The therapy employs a dual approach: directly killing\ntumor cells via the release of drugs from VNP@ApDC and\nrecruitment of T cells by the proliferation of bacteria. This not\nonly targets the tumor cells but also initiates a transformative\nprocess in the TME. The subsequent recruitment of T cells, driven\nby the disruption of tumor cells and bacterial proliferation, fosters\na more penetrative and active immune response within the\ndeeper layers of the tumor tissue. Importantly, this study had\nconsidered the role of the immunosuppressive environment in\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors. The immuno-\nsuppressive environment of PDAC tumors may have contributed\nto the survival and proliferation of Salmonella within the tumor.\nThis immunosuppressive state was lacking in normal tissues,\nallowing Salmonella to preferentially accumulate within the tumor\nmicroenvironment.\nAn essential aspect of this therapy is its potential to modify the\nTME. By breaking down tumor cells and encouraging bacterial\nproliferation, the treatment alters the microenvironment to favor\nimmune cell inﬁltration and activity. This alteration is particularly\ncrucial in the context of pancreatic cancer wherein the TME\ntypically acts as a protective haven for the tumor and poses a\nsigniﬁcant obstacle to conventional treatments.\nDespite the study’s primary focus on the therapeutic effects on\nprimary tumors, one of the key challenges of PDAC is that the\ntumor often metastasizes before the primary tumor is detected.\nBased on the targeting properties of VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE and its\neffectiveness in primary tumors, we speculate that it may also\nexhibit similar targeting accumulation and antitumor effects in\nmetastatic tumors. Future studies will be necessary to further\nvalidate the efﬁcacy of VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE in metastatic tumor\nmodels.\nWhile this study proposes a highly promising therapeutic\nstrategy, further research is essential to fully understand its\nefﬁcacy and safety. Future clinical trials will be crucial in\ndetermining the practical applicability of this approach and\nassessing its potential to enhance the survival rates and quality\nof life for pancreatic cancer patients.\nVNP20009 was administered intravenously in Phase I clinical\ntrials. The safety of bacterial injections is supported by clinical\ntrials showing tolerability. However, alternative administration\nroutes such as oral administration and fecal transplantation should\nbe explored to minimize systemic immune activation and offer a\nmore targeted approach. The impact of fecal transplantation on\nthe microbiome must be carefully evaluated to ensure therapeutic\nbeneﬁts outweigh any disruptions to the natural microbial\nbalance. Such studies are crucial for understanding the compre-\nhensive safety proﬁle and efﬁcacy of VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE in a\nclinical setting. Future research will focus on optimizing bacterial\nstrains, reﬁning aptamer design, exploring suitable administration\nroutes, and exploring combination therapies for better outcomes.\nIn conclusion, the study sets forth a highly promising and\ninnovative therapeutic strategy that holds the potential to\nsigniﬁcantly impact pancreatic cancer treatment. By effectively\ncombining different therapeutic modalities and overcoming the\ntumor microenvironment, this approach could address and\npotentially overcome some of the most signiﬁcant challenges in\nthe current landscape of pancreatic cancer treatment.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe related biological and chemical products were summarized as\nfollows:\n3-Azido-D-alanine hydrochloride (Baseclick GmbH, Inc.), Malei-\nmidocaproyl-Val-Cit-PABC-monomethyl auristatin E (Monmouth\nJunction,\nInc.),\nTris(2-carboxyethyl)\nphosphine\nhydrochloride\n(TCEP, Sigma Aldrich), Anti-h/rPTK7/CCK4 Alexa Fluor® 488-\nconjugated Antibody (R&D Systems Co.

ApDC concentration was calculated using\nthe regression equation obtained from the standard curve.\nProliferation of bacteria\nTo examine whether the surface-bound Sgc8c-MMAE affects the\ngrowth of VNP, the modiﬁed VNP (VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE) was\ncultured in 100% LB broth. The growth curve over a 12-h period\nwas recorded by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm via\nplate reader (BioTek Synergy H1, USA).\nBinding ability of VNP@ApDC to pancreatic cancer cells\nCells were seeded in confocal dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells\nper dish in 1 mL of DMEM medium containing 10% FBS. Three\npancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1, Miapaca-2, and KPC1199)\nwere cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment for 24 h.\nSubsequently, cells were incubated with Cy5-labeled Sgc8c,\nLibrary, Sgc8c-MMAE, or VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE for 30 min at 4 °C.\nThen cells were washed three times with PBS and visualized using\na laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM, Leica TCS SP8 X,\nGermany). To quantify cellular uptake, cells were harvested and\nprepared for ﬂow cytometry analysis.\nConstruction of mouse models\nXenograft model: Six-week-old mice were used for xenograft\nstudies. For Miapaca-2 tumor xenograft model, cells were cultured\nin DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and\n1% penicillin–streptomycin. For xenograft implantation, 1 × 106\nMiapaca-2\ncells\nwere\nresuspended\nin\n100 μL\nof\nMatrigel\n(BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into the right ﬂank\nof six-week-old nude mice. For KPC1199 tumor xenograft model,\ncells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine\nserum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.\nFor xenograft\nimplantation, 3 × 105 KPC1199 cells were resuspended in 100 μL\nof Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into the\nright ﬂank of 6-week-old C57 mice. Tumor volume was measured\nusing a digital caliper and calculated as volume=width2 × length\n× 0.5. Experiments were conducted when the tumor volume\nreached 100 mm3.\nPDX model was kindly provided by Liwei Wang and his group\nmembers (KY [2019] 035).\nIn-situ carcinoma model: A total of 2 × 105 KPC1199-Luc cells\nresuspended in 10 μL of Matrigel were implanted into the\npancreatic epithelium of C57 mice (Male, 6-week-old). Subse-\nquently, the ﬂuorescence signal was captured with an IVIS Lumina\nXP imaging system. Experiments were conducted when the tumor\nvolume reached 100 mm3.\nAll studies were reviewed and approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Renji Hospital (RJ2021-0621) and were performed\naccording to NIH guidelines.\nFlow cytometry analysis\nTumors were excised, minced, and digested in collagenase IV\n(1 mg/mL) and DNase I (0.1 mg/mL) for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Single-\ncell suspensions were prepared by ﬁltering through a 70-μm cell\nstrainer. Cells were stained with antibodies against CD45, CD4,\nCD8, CD11c, MHCII, Ly6G, F4/80, IFN-γ, TNF-α, T-bet, and granzyme\nB (GzmB). Data were acquired on a ﬂow cytometer and analyzed\nusing FlowJo software.\nBiodistribution study\nTo investigate biodistribution, mice bearing Miapaca-2 or KPC1199\ntumors were intravenously administered with 0.1 mL of VNP,\nVNP@Lib-MMAE, and VNP@Sgc8c-MMAE containing 1 × 107 CFU\n(n = 3 mice/group). All mice were imaged at certain time points\nwith an IVIS Lumina XP imaging system. Main organs and tumors\nwere collected after imaging and then homogenized in a glass\nhomogenizer. The homogenates were diluted in LB medium, and\n50 μL of each dilution was plated on LB agar plates containing\nantibiotics. The plates were then incubated overnight at 37 °C for\nbacterial colony counting.\nCalculation of distance between ApDC and tumor edge\nTumor tissue images underwent processing in both ImageJ and\nMATLAB to generate a semi-quantitative Euclidean Map, following\na methodology similar to that described by Ian Nessler et al.39\nBrieﬂy, the 405 nm plane was isolated and transformed into a\nbinary image, effectively masking all areas within the tumor tissue,\nwith only pixels outside the tumor tissue retaining non-zero\nintensity. This binary image was then exported to MATLAB and\nprocessed\nusing\nthe\nbuilt-in\nEuclidean\nDistance\nTransform\nfunction, resulting in a pixel distance matrix. This matrix contained\nthe distance of each pixel within the tumor from the nearest non-\nzero pixel, predominantly situated around the edges of the tumor\ntissue. Next, the 488 nm and 635 nm planes of the same image\nwere isolated and converted into grayscale images by MATLAB,\nwhere the signal intensity at each pixel was extracted and plotted\nagainst the corresponding Euclidean distance. This process\nyielded a Euclidean distance map illustrating the spatial distribu-\ntion of signal intensity within the tumor tissue.\nSingle-cell sequencing\nSingle-cell Isolation and Sequencing Library Preparation: Tumor\nsamples from mice treated with KPC1199 were processed into\nsingle-cell suspensions. Post-quality assessment, the cell concen-\ntration was set between 700 and 1200 cells per microliter for\ncompatibility with the 10x Genomics Chromium™system. The\nmRNA underwent reverse transcription using a poly(T) primer that\nincorporates a barcode sequence via the Template Switch\nOligo (TSO).\nscRNA-seq: Gene expression matrix was generated per sample\nusing CellRanger (v6.1.2) and then converted to a Seurat object\nusing the Seurat R package (v4.0.4). Predicted doublets were\nremoved using DoubletFinder (v2.0.3). Batch effect was performed\non each sample using the R package harmony (v0.1.0). Cell type\nannotation was based on the expression of biomarkers in each\ncluster. Tumor cells were reconﬁrmed using the R package\ninfercnv (v1.12.0).\nIn vivo cancer therapy\nMice\nwere\ndivided\ninto\ndifferent\ngroups,\nand\nPBS,\nVNP,\nVNP@Sgc8c-MMAE or other related drugs (100 µL) were injected\nintravenously. Tumor dimensions were measured every other day\nwith digital calipers.\nELISA assay for cytokine secretion\nTumor tissues were collected and homogenized after euthanizing\nthe mice on day 14. The concentrations of cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ,\nCCL-5 and IL-6) in the tumor tissues were then measured using\nELISA following the manufacturer’s protocol.\nH&E staining\nTumors and main organs were collected from mice and ﬁxed in\n4% paraformaldehyde. H&E staining was performed according to\nthe manufacturer’s protocol.\nImmunohistochemistry\nTumor tissues were ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,\nembedded in parafﬁn, and sectioned at 4–5 μm thickness.\nSections were deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, and subjected to\nantigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked,\nfollowed by incubation with primary antibodies against Ki67, α-\nSMA, PTK7, and collagen. After washing, sections were incubated\nAptamer-drug conjugates-loaded bacteria for pancreatic cancer synergistic. . .\nXiao et al.\n15\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy   (2024) 9:272"}, {"page_number": 16, "text": "with secondary antibodies, followed by streptavidin-HRP and DAB\nsubstrate for color development.

Metabolic abnormalities are one of the hallmarks of pancreatic\ncancer, and pancreatic cancer cells can adapt to biosynthesis, energy intake, and redox needs through metabolic reprogramming to\ntolerate nutrient deﬁciency and hypoxic microenvironments. Pancreatic cancer cells can use glucose, amino acids, and lipids as\nenergy to maintain malignant growth. Moreover, they also metabolically interact with cells in the tumour microenvironment to\nchange cell fate, promote tumour progression, and even affect immune responses. Importantly, metabolic changes at the body\nlevel deserve more attention. Basic research and clinical trials based on targeted metabolic therapy or in combination with other\ntreatments are in full swing. A more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the metabolic regulation of pancreatic cancer\ncells will not only enrich the understanding of the mechanisms of disease progression but also provide inspiration for new\ndiagnostic and therapeutic approaches.\nCell Death and Disease  (2024) 15:553 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06930-0\nKEY FACTS\n●\nMetabolic reprogramming is one of the key hallmarks in\npancreatic cancer.\n●\nTargeting key enzymes in metabolic pathways can affect the\nprogression of pancreatic cancer.\n●\nThe complex tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer\ncreates metabolic heterogeneity.\n●\nClinical\ntrials\nexploring\nmetabolic-based\ntreatments\nfor\npancreatic cancer have been initiated.\n●\nAdvanced technologies (including preclinical models and\ndetection technologies) continue to promote progress in the\nﬁeld.\nKEY QUESTIONS\n●\nInﬂuencing\nredox\nhomeostasis\nbrings\nhope\nfor\ncancer\ntreatment.\n●\nPolyamine metabolism and microbial metabolic targets still\nneed further exploration.\n●\nInteractions between metabolism and epigenetics and meta-\nbolic cell death are blue oceans.\n●\nSystemic metabolism can also serve as a potential pathogenic\nmechanism and therapeutic target.\n●\nBreakthroughs are urgently needed to overcome the low\nspeciﬁcity and side effects of metabolic therapy.\nINTRODUCTION\nTumour cells have many unique characteristics, and many of these\ncharacteristics, are directly controlled by cell metabolism or amenable\nto regulation by speciﬁc metabolites [1]. Since the Warburg effect was\nidentiﬁed a century ago [2], a variety of metabolic reprogramming\nevents have been revealed in tumour cells [3]. The Warburg effect\nrefers to persistent glycolysis even when oxygen is abundant, which\nprovides ATP but is primarily a precursors for the synthesis of various\nbiological macromolecules [4]. With the rapid development of new\ntechnologies, it has been gradually discovered that… tumour\nmetabolism involves an overall change at multiple levels of the\nmetabolic network and plays an important role in promoting the\noccurrence and development of tumours [5, 6].\nMetabolic reprogramming [7], which refers to the adaptive\nchanges in the balance of anabolism and catabolism that occur in\ntumour cells during the malignant development process to meet\nthe large demand for materials and energy, has gradually become\nrecognized as one of the crucial hallmarks of cancer [8]. This\nreprogramming allows tumour cells to gain advantages and\nsurvive in the nutrient-starved tumour microenvironment (TME)\ncaused by rapid proliferation [9].\nIn contrast to the booming research ﬁeld, only a few\nmetabolism-based cancer drugs have been successfully devel-\noped and are still in the nascent stage due to their low speciﬁcity\nand undesirable side effects [10]. These strategies targeting the\nintrinsic metabolism of cancer cells usually do not consider the\ncomplex crosstalk of noncancerous stromal cells and immune\ncells, still awaiting further research [11–13].\nReceived: 18 April 2024 Revised: 17 July 2024 Accepted: 22 July 2024\n1Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.\n2Department of Clinical Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.\n✉email: liuziwen@pumch.cn\nEdited by Francesca Pentimalli\nwww.nature.com/cddis\nOfﬁcial journal of CDDpress\n1234567890();,:"}, {"page_number": 2, "text": "Pancreatic cancer (PC), is an aggressive cancer with a poor\nprognosis [14]. The overall ﬁve-year survival rate is less than 13%,\nand it is expected that PC will rank second in malignant tumour-\nrelated deaths in the United States by 2030 [15]. Exploring the\nmetabolic\nregulatory\nnetwork\nand\nunderlying\nmechanisms,\nformulating comprehensive treatment strategies, and promoting\nprecise treatment based on individual patients are expected to\nimprove the overall prognosis.\nThis review summarizes the main themes that are currently\nunder investigation in the context of tumour metabolism and\nprovides an overview of the current status of basic research and\nclinical trials targeting key enzymes and signaling pathways in PC\nmetabolism (Fig. 1).\nMETABOLIC REPROGRAMMING OF TUMOUR CELLS\nNucleotide metabolism\nThe enhanced synthesis and use of nucleotide triphosphates\n(NTPs) is a universal metabolic dependence across different cancer\ntypes [16]. Oncogenic drivers increase nucleotide biosynthetic\ncapacity, which is a prerequisite for cancer initiation and\nprogression [17]. The clinical utility of nucleotide synthesis\ninhibitors, the ﬁrst antineoplastic agents discovered, has been\ndemonstrated in many cancers [18]. As they have been extensively\nstudied and due to space limitations, we summarize the key\nenzymes and inhibitors in nucleotide metabolism in Text Box S1.\nIn addition to the de novo and salvage pathways, pancreatic\nductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells can also acquire nucleotides\nthrough autophagy, speciﬁcally through the degradation of\ncellular nucleic acids in autophagosomes, especially in hypoxic\nand nutrient-poor regions of the TME [19]. Recent studies have\nalso shown that nucleotide metabolism is not only a therapeutic\ntarget for chemotherapy but also has the potential to become a\nsensitization target for immunotherapy, which we will describe\nlater [20].\nGlycolysis and OXPHOS\nOtto Warburg ﬁrst discovered in the late 1920s that increased\naerobic glycolysis in tumour cells [21], also known as the Warburg\neffect, allows tumour cells to survive under the harsh conditions of\ncancer progression [22]. Glycolysis is the primary way PC cells\ngenerate energy to sustain malignant proliferation, including\nunder hypoxic conditions [23, 24]. Work in mouse models also\ndemonstrated that glycolysis is the major metabolic effector of\noncogenic KRAS [25].\nFirst, the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is\nupregulated, increasing glucose uptake to enhance subsequent\naerobic glycolysis [26]. LIMS1 enhances GLUT1 expression and\nmembrane translocation, which promotes cancer cell survival\nunder oxygen-glucose deprivation [27]. Key enzymes involved in\nglycolysis play a role in PC. Hexokinase 1/2 (HK1/2) converts\nglucose into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), the rate-limiting ﬁrst\nstep in glycolysis. The binding of HK2 to mitochondria increases\nthe glycolytic capacity and promotes PDAC immortalization [28].\nRecent\nresearch\nhas\nshown\nthat\nthe\nendogenous\ncellular\nmetabolic checkpoint STING can limit aerobic glycolysis by\ntargeting HK2 [29]. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyses the\nsecond critical step in glycolysis [30]. The production of the\nPFKFB-4 and PFKFB-3 isoenzymes is induced by hypoxia in PC [31].\nPyruvate kinase (PK) catalyses the conversion of phosphoenolpyr-\nuvate to pyruvate, which is the ﬁnal rate-limiting step of glycolysis\nand can transfer metabolites to branch pathways [32]. Some\nstudies have shown that methionine can oxidatively activate\nPKM2 to promote PC metastasis [33], while other studies have\nshown that PKM2 expression is not required for carcinogenesis or\nprogression in PDAC [34]. Under conditions of glucose deﬁciency,\nfructose can be taken up and metabolized by PDAC cells to\npromote adaptive survival [35].\nThe expression of several enzymes involved in glycolysis, such\nas aldolase [36], glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(GAPDH) [37], phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) [38], phosphogly-\ncerate mutase (PGAM) [39], and alpha enolase (ENO-1) [40], is\nupregulated in PC. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is overexpressed\nin PDAC [41], and LDH-mediated catalysis of pyruvate to lactate is\nsigniﬁcantly increased [42]; thus, LDH may be an effective\ntherapeutic target [43].\nIn contrast to glycolysis, phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogen-\nase kinase 1 (PDHK1) inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)\nin PDAC [26]. Nonetheless, some studies have shown that OXPHOS\nis not always suppressed; rather, it can be reactivated under\ncertain conditions [44]. The oncogene KRAS and the loss of LKB1\nmay drive the upregulation of OXPHOS in cancer [44]. The\ntranscription factor ISL2 can regulate the expression of metabolic\ngenes and affect OXPHOS [45]. As tumours proliferate rapidly, cells\nin the tumour core become hypoxic, and OXPHOS decreases.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that OXPHOS inhibitors can\nserve as promising therapeutic agents for treating PDAC [46]. The\nmolecular\nmechanism\nunderlying\nthe\nrelationship\nbetween\nOXPHOS and PDAC progression still requires in-depth study with\nbright prospects (Text Box S2).\nAmino acid metabolism\nAmino acid metabolism, which can affect cancer cell status and\nsystemic metabolism through energy metabolism and signal\ntransduction, is deregulated in PDAC [47].\nGlutamine is the most abundant nonessential amino acid in the\nhuman body [48]. Cancer cells can convert glutamine into lactic\nacid, participate in a glucose-free metabolic pathway, take up\nglutamine, and promote the synthesis of nonessential amino acids\nand nucleotides through carbon or nitrogen metabolism [49].\nGenerally, glutamine can be converted in the mitochondria to\nsupplement the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or it can be\ncompletely\noxidized\nto\nproduce\nATP.\nMany\nstudies\nhave\nconﬁrmed that glutamine plays a very important role in the\nmigration and invasion of PDAC cells [50–52] and relies on\nnoncanonical metabolic pathways. Glutamine-derived aspartate is\nconverted into oxaloacetate by aspartate transaminase GOT1;\nsubsequently, oxaloacetate is converted into malate and then\npyruvate, which can potentially maintain redox homeostasis [53].\nLoss of SIRT5 promotes tumorigenesis by increasing noncanonical\nglutamine utilization through GOT1 and is expected to serve as a\nsuppressor in PDAC [54]. GOT1 inhibition-mediated impairment of\nredox balance synergizes with radiotherapy mouse models [55].\nThe adaptation of PDAC cells to nutrient deprivation is reversible,\nand\nglutamine\nsynthetase\n(GS)\nis\nexpected\nto\nbecome\na\ntherapeutic target for patients with PDAC [56]. Alanine, serine,\nand cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2) is responsible for glutamine\ntransport [57]. Recent studies have shown that CD9 promotes the\nplasma membrane localization of the glutamine transporter\nASCT2, thereby enhancing glutamine uptake [58]. In preclinical\nmodels, PI3K-C2γ deﬁciency can overactivate the mTORC1 path-\nway and reprogram glutamine metabolism, increasing invasive-\nness\n[59].\nTargeting\nglutamine\nmetabolism\nmay\nprovide\ntherapeutic avenues for treating PDAC [60], and glutamine\nmimicry inhibits tumour progression through asparagine meta-\nbolism [61].\nIn addition, many studies have found that other amino acids,\nsuch as serine, tryptophan, methionine, and branched-chain\namino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, play a role in different\nstages of tumors and are expected to develop new intervention\nstrategies. We summarize them in Text Box S3.\nRecently, polyamine metabolism has been redeﬁned as an\nanticancer strategy and may be involved in antitumour immune\nresponses [62, 63]. The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway has\nbeen shown to control multiple aspects of polyamine metabolism\nin preclinical models [64]. Arginine deprivation can inhibit the\nH.

Arginine is the\nprecursor of polyamines, and Lee et al. reported that PDAC cells\ncan synthesize polyamines from glutamine, revealing a new\npathway [66]. PDAC can synthesize ornithine from glutamine and\nsupport polyamine synthesis through ornithine aminotransferase\n(OAT), thereby promoting tumour growth [67]. Cancer cells require\nelevated levels of polyamines to sustain proliferation [67];\nmicrobiota- and diet-related polyamine metabolism will be\ndescribed later.\nLipid metabolism\nLipids not only provide energy but are also widely distributed in\norganelles and serve as second messengers to transduce signals\nwithin cells [68]. Therefore, lipid metabolism is increasingly\nrecognized as an important pathway for cancer cells [69, 70].\nLipid metabolism reprogramming can be observed even outside\nhistological tumour boundaries [71], and lipidomic analysis of\nserum holds promise for detecting PDAC [72].\nExogenous fatty acid (FA) uptake confers metabolic ﬂexibility to\ncancer cells [73]. Cancer cells can absorb fatty acids through fatty\nacid transporter proteins (FATPs) [74], fatty acid translocase (CD36)\n[75], and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) [76]. CD36 is thought\nto be involved in the initiation of metastasis [77] and the\npromotion of fatty acid β-oxidation to support proliferation [78].\nExcess exogenous FAs are stored in lipid droplets (LDs), which\nsequester FAs in the form of triacylglycerides (TAGs) and sterol\nesters and can be used for energy production or phospholipid\nsynthesis [79]. Increased LD abundance is related to tumour\naggressiveness, and reduced LD abundance can reduce the\ninvasive ability of KRAS-mutant PDAC [80]. β-oxidation of stored\nlipids can produce acetyl-CoA, which is subsequently shuttled\nthrough the TCA cycle, providing a valuable source of ATP and\nNADPH under conditions of metabolic stress [81].\nThe de novo synthesis of lipids is a metabolic source for tumour\ncell growth, even in the presence of exogenous lipids [70]. Acetyl-\nCoA is the main substrate for lipid synthesis. Cancer cells can\nupregulate\nacetyl-CoA\nsynthetase\n2\n(ACSS2)\nexpression\nto\ngenerate acetyl-CoA from acetate [82] or upregulate ATP-citrate\nlyase (ACLY) expression to convert citrate to acetyl-CoA [83].\nGlucose undergoes pyruvate oxidation through the TCA cycle,\nwhile glutamine promotes citric acid production through reduc-\ntive carboxylation [84].\nThe regulation of de novo lipogenesis mainly occurs at the\ntranscription level, and sterol regulatory element binding proteins\n(SREBPs) can regulate genes related to fatty acid and cholesterol\nsynthesis and uptake [85]. Liver X receptors (LXRs) [86], whose\ninhibitory ligands can hinder cell proliferation in various forms of\ncancer, regulate FA and cholesterol metabolism [87]. Acetyl-CoA\ncarboxylase (ACC) [88], fatty acid synthase (FASN) [89], and\nstearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) [90] are rate-limiting enzymes for\nFA synthesis and are signiﬁcantly highly expressed in PDAC. ACC1\nis genetically regulated by SREBP at the transcription level [91]. In\nrecent years, FASN has received increasing attention as a potential\ntarget for cancer therapy, and its high expression is associated\nwith poor survival and gemcitabine resistance [92]. Under hypoxic\nconditions, the ﬂux from glucose to acetyl-CoA is reduced, and\nsaturated fatty acids are regulated by SCD1, reducing the\nconversion to monounsaturated fatty acids [93]. SCD1 expression\nis associated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients and can\nprotect cancer cells from ferroptosis, indicating its antitumour\npotential [94].\nCholesterol plays a key role in maintaining membrane integrity\nand ﬂuidity and regulating cell signalling events [95]. Abnormal\ncholesterol metabolism can support PDAC growth [96]. The\nuptake of cholesterol depends on the LDLR-mediated endocytosis\npathway. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles bind to the LDL\nreceptor (LDLR) and are eventually internalized and then reach the\nlysosome\nto\nrelease\nfree\ncholesterol\n[97].\nDecreased\ntotal\ncholesterol and LDL levels may be associated with the develop-\nment of PDAC [98]. Some studies have also shown that LDLR\nexpression is positively correlated with poor prognosis and\nrecurrence [99]. Cholesterol is synthesized through the mevalo-\nnate pathway and is regulated by several key enzymes, such as\nacetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT) [100], 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-\nglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) [101], squalene monooxygenase\n(SM) [102], and sterol-O-acyltransferase (SOAT) [103], which may\nprovide new ideas for the treatment of PDAC [104]. In contrast, the\nlevel of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, which is\nassociated with cholesterol efﬂux, is signiﬁcantly inversely related\nto the risk of cancer [105]. In preclinical models, disruption of\ncholesterol biosynthesis promotes a shift to a basal phenotype,\nconferring a poor prognosis [106]. Targeting SOAT1 can affect p53\nmutant\nPDAC\norganoids\nthat\nare\nsensitive\nto\ncholesterol\nmetabolism and impair tumor progression [103].\nFatty acid oxidation (FAO), also known as β-oxidation, is\nincreased in many cancer cells because cancer cells can use fatty\nacid (FA) catabolism to proliferate when ATP is depleted\n[107, 108]. FAO can participate in tumorigenesis [109] and tumour\nmetastasis [110] and may be related to cachexia [111]. Among\ndifferent fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are easily\noxidized, with lipid peroxidation leading to various types of cell\ndeath, while saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated\nfatty acids (MUFAs), on the contrary, are thought to promote\ncancer growth [112, 113].\nFinally, the sophisticated mechanisms and functions of phos-\npholipid metabolism [114] and sphingolipid metabolism [115]\nhave also been increasingly revealed. Increased glycosphingolipid\nbiosynthesis can localize KRAS to the plasma membrane [116].\nMUFAs and their linked ether phospholipids play a key role in\nmaintaining reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis [117].\nRedox homeostasis\nCellular redox homeostasis is an important process for cell\nsurvival, and ROS can cause damage to cellular components\n[118]. In addition, cancer cells have an increased demand for\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which leads to a\nrestorative stress state [119]. Several transcription factors are\nactivated by ROS, regulate the redox status of cells and are\nimplicated in carcinogenesis [120]. New technologies for measur-\ning and manipulating reducing stress offer promise for cancer\ntreatment [121].\nAs mentioned previously, the glutamine metabolic pathway in\nPDAC cells is often referred to as the noncanonical pathway.\nGlutamine deprivation [122] and the inhibition of GOT1 [123] or\nGOT2 [124, 125] increase intracellular ROS. CRISPR/Cas9 ablation of\nGlutamate–Ammonia Ligase (GLUL) in PDAC mouse models\nreduced tumor growth [51]. Cancer cells rely on cysteine-derived\nmetabolites such as glutathione (GSH) and CoA to alleviate ROS\n[118, 126]. GSH is the most abundant antioxidant in cells mainly to\nscavenge free radicals and maintain cellular redox homeostasis\n[127]. Cysteine is taken up by SLC7A11 (also called xCT) [128]. The\nexpression of SLC7A11 and cystine uptake can be mediated by\nmitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), potentially inhibiting\nPDAC metastasis [129].\nFerroptosis is caused by the excessive accumulation of lipid ROS\n[130]. The Fenton reaction produced by labile iron in cancer cells\npromotes the peroxidation of membrane-bound lipids containing\npolyunsaturated fatty acids [131]. In preclinical models, cysteine\ndepletion and promotion of ferroptosis inhibited PDAC growth\n[132]. NRF2 can activate downstream suppressor genes through\ntranscription, the trans-sulfur pathway can convert methionine\ninto cysteine, and the mTOR pathway can increase GPX4 protein\nsynthesis, all of which can improve ferroptosis resistance [133].\nCysteine depletion can induce ferroptosis [132]. ROS-enhanced\nphototherapy via the Nrf2-mediated stress-defence pathway and\nferroptosis can inhibit PDAC [134]. Increasing the labile iron in\nH.

Recent groundbreak-\ning studies expand our understanding of the mechanisms of\n7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in ferroptosis through cholesterol\nmetabolism [137, 138]. The unique ferroptosis response mediated\nby PHLDA2 is likely independent of ACSL4 and does not require\ncommon ferroptosis inducers [139].\nSeveral other metabolic targets that modulate ROS toxicity are\nalso being studied preclinically [140, 141]. Inhibiting nicotinamide\nphosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) to block NAD+ synthesis can\ninhibit tumour growth [142] and has been carried out in clinical\ntrials [143, 144]. New concepts and attempts related to NAD+\nmetabolism are being made, but its double-edged sword effect\nreﬂects the complexity of regulating redox homeostasis in cancer\n[145, 146].\nOther metabolic alterations\nThere are also several metabolism-related targets or pathways that\nhave not been covered in previous chapters. KRAS mutations are\namong the earliest events in pancreatic carcinogenesis and can\ndrive common metabolic programs and promote tumour progres-\nsion [147]. In the normal pancreas, acinar cells use amino acids to\nsynthesize\ndigestive\nenzymes,\nand ductal\ncells\nare\nmainly\nresponsible for the transport of peptides and hormones. In the\ncase of KRAS mutations, acinar cells can transform into ductal cells\nand are considered the origin of PDAC [148]. These changes also\noccur in ductal cells [149]. In the transformed state, KRAS PDAC\ncells possess metabolic programs intrinsic to acinar and ductal\ncells [150].\nTo adapt to harsh environments, PDAC cells rely on lysosomes\nfor nutrient degradation and regeneration, such as through\nmacropinocytosis [151] and autophagy [152], to obtain sufﬁcient\nfuel for survival [153, 154]. Macropinosomes can nonselectively\ninternalize and absorb a large amount of extracellular ﬂuid and\nultimately metabolize amino acids into central carbon to support\nthe growth of cancer cells [155]. Oncogenic RAS induces\nmacropinocytosis [156] and is regulated by EGFR-Pak signalling\n[157] and syndecan 1 (SDC1) [158]. Autophagy can degrade\ncellular macromolecules and organelles, maintain cell homeostasis\nand survival [159], and maintain PDAC growth [160]. A lack of\nextracellular supplies enhances autophagy [161], and increased\nautophagy on ferritin maintains iron availability and thereby\npromotes tumour progression [162]. Research has shown that\nautophagy promotes immune evasion in PDAC by degrading\nMHC-I [163] and that the combination of MEK and autophagy\ninhibition may inhibit PDAC [164]. Preclinical model results further\nsupport the critical role of autophagy in tumor maintenance [160].\nBecause\nmetabolic\nreprogramming\ncauses\ndifferences\nin\nmetabolites in cells, epigenetic modiﬁcations such as lactylation\n[165], succinylation [166], glycosylation [167] and SUMOylation\n[168] may also cause different trends in tumour development. For\nexample, SIRT4 can inhibit tumorigenesis by inducing autophagy\n[169], while Smarcd3 can establish aggressive lipid metabolism\nremodelling [170]. The interaction between metabolic reprogram-\nming and epigenetics has gradually become the focus of recent\nresearch [171–173]. Moreover, some inhibitors have been tested in\npreclinical models [174].\nRecent studies have discovered new forms of regulated cell\ndeath resulting from imbalances in cellular metabolism [175].\nCopper-dependent signalling pathways were also identiﬁed and\ncharacterized [176]. Lysosomal function is upregulated in cancer\ncells and TRPML1 is a cation channel with dual permeability to\nCa2+ and Zn2+, but excessive Zn2+ will hinder mitochondrial\nfunction and eventually lead to cell death [177]. Disulﬁde death\nrelies on SLC7A11-mediated cystine transport, which may be\nresistant to ferroptosis therapy, but is glucose and NADPH\ndependent [178]. Disruption of intracellular pH balance, such as\nthe selective inhibitor JTC801, triggers alkaline death by blocking\nOPRL1 and inhibits PDAC growth [179]. Although the role of\nmetabolic cell death is controversial, these may provide insights\nfor novel therapeutic interventions.\nMETABOLISM OF THE TUMOUR MICROENVIRONMENT\nThe PDAC microenvironment is highly intricate and heteroge-\nneous. In addition to cancer cells, there is also an extracellular\nmatrix (ECM), stromal cells, immune cells, etc., and their metabolic\ninteractions play a key role in the occurrence and development of\nPDAC [180].\nPDAC cells are surrounded by dense proliferating connective\ntissue, which is composed of collagen mesh, leading to hypoxia\nand nutrient deﬁciency in tumours [181]. In this environment,\ncancer cells can activate the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway to\nenhance glycolysis [182] and even use collagen to provide energy\n[183]. Connexin-43 channels can transport excess lactate pro-\nduced by glycolysis and maintain a suitable chemical environment\n[184]. The lactate receptor GPR81 has also been reported to\nregulate the lactate transport mechanism [185]. Correspondingly,\nlactic acid also promotes tumour invasiveness through angiogen-\nesis, immune evasion, and cell migration [186].\nPancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), especially activated PSCs (aPSCs)\nand cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAFs), are the main compo-\nnents of the PDAC stroma [187, 188]. Inﬂammatory CAFs can\npromote PDAC progression [189]. Pancreatic CAFs can support the\ncellular metabolism of PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo by secreting\nmetabolites [190], which is known as the reverse Warburg effect\n[191]. Metabolic crosstalk between PDAC cells and CAFs can be\nachieved by alanine uptake by speciﬁc transporters, such as the\nneutral amino acid transporter SLC38A2 [192]. Lau et al. con-\nstructed an organoid-ﬁbroblast co-culture system and found that\nPDAC cells showed increased pyruvate carboxylation [193]. Cancer\ncells release tryptophan-derived formate, which can be used by\nPSCs to support purine nucleotide synthesis [194]. CAFs can\nsecrete lipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPA) and promote\nPDAC cell progression and AKT activation through the autotaxin-\nLPA axis [195]. Meanwhile, CAFs can secrete pyrimidines and\ndeoxycytidine, inhibiting the effects of gemcitabine [196], and\nsecrete cytokines and chemokines that support PDAC progression\n[197]. Recent\nstudies have shown\nthat CAFs\ncan provide\nbioavailable iron to resist autophagy [198] and secrete cysteine\nto support glutathione synthesis [199], which induces ferroptosis\nresistance. Metabolic interactions between cancer cells and PSCs\nalso overcome the redox limitations of cell proliferation [200].\nSingle-cell sequencing revealed a novel subpopulation of CAFs\n(named\nmediated\nCAFs\n(meCAFs))\nwith\nabnormal\nglucose\nmetabolism that are associated with a poor prognosis but may\nbetter respond to immunotherapy [201]. Because ﬁbroblasts have\nmultiple functions that support or suppress PDAC, it is of great\nsigniﬁcance to understand the mechanisms and develop targeted\ntherapies.\nNerve invasion is a characteristic of PDAC and is related to\nprognosis\n[202].\nNeurotrophic\nfactors\nor\nneurotransmitters\nsecreted\nby\nneurons\nhave\nbeen\nshown\nto\nhave\ntumour-\npromoting effects [203], and the secretion of serine is a newly\ndiscovered metabolic crosstalk mechanism [204].\nAdipocytes can meet high nutritional demands by secreting\nadipokines and disrupting lipid metabolism and, in addition, have\nthe potential to transdifferentiate into ﬁbroblast-like cells [205].\nAdipocytes may also contribute to the malignant progression of\nPDAC through metabolic interactions [206], such as through\nglutamine secretion [207] or through interactions with tumour-\nassociated neutrophils [208].\nImmune cells are important components of the TME, and\ncontinuously activated inﬂammatory pathways can promote the\noccurrence of cancer [13]. The known metabolic patterns of\nimmune\ncells\nare\nmainly\ndifferent:\nactivated\nimmune\ncell\nH.

The\ninﬁltration and activation of tumour-associated macrophages\n(TAMs) can promote immune evasion and matrix remodelling in\nPDAC [210]. The metabolic reprogramming of TAMs through\ncollagen turnover can result in a proﬁbrotic proﬁle [211]. The\nsimultaneous exposure to hyperglycaemia and macrophages can\nincrease the migratory potential of PDAC cells through the\nepithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition\n(EMT)\n[212].\nTAMs\ncan\ndifferentiate into M1 or M2 phenotypes to adapt to the\nmicroenvironment [213]; for example, lactate promotes the\nproto-oncogenic M2-like polarization of TAMs, while through\nmetabolic normalization, TAMs can transform into an anticancer\nM1 phenotype in preclinical models [214, 215]. Conversely, TAMs\ncan also enhance glycolysis in PDAC cells by secreting cytokines,\nsuch as IL-8 [216]. Arginase 1 in immunosuppressive macrophages\nconsumes arginine and inhibits T-cell inﬁltration [217]. Reducing\nthe levels of the immune metabolite itaconic acid through ACOD1\ndepletion enhances CAR-macrophage function [218].\nT cells are the pioneers of adaptive immune responses, and the\ninﬁltration of different types of T cell subsets has different effects\non tumours [219]. Single-cell sequencing enables the analysis of\nthe metabolic status and metabolite dynamics of T-cell subsets\nand their interactions with immunity [220]. Type II cytokines\nsecreted by Th2 cells can stimulate cancer cell-intrinsic MYC\ntranscriptional\nupregulation\nto\ndrive\nglycolysis,\naccelerating\ntumour growth [221]. Tryptophan and arginine are required for\neffector function and T-cell survival [222]. IDO is overexpressed in\nPDAC and inhibits antitumour T cell responses, and it catalyses the\nconversion of tryptophan to kynurenine [223]. To meet metabolic\ndemands upon glucose deprivation, tumour-inﬁltrating lympho-\ncytes (TILs) may be forced to enhance OXPHOS, thereby increasing\nROS levels and ultimately leading to dysfunction and failure [224].\nRegulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells\n(MDSCs) are also affected by metabolic reprogramming in the\nTME, which results in immunosuppression [225]. B cells can induce\ntumour-promoting\nand\nimmunosuppressive\neffects.\nTumour-\nassociated neutrophils (TANs) can promote a hypoxic microenvir-\nonment and immunosuppression [226]. BHLHE40-driven TANs\nexhibit hyperactivated glycolysis with pro-oncogenic and immu-\nnosuppressive functions [227]. However, current research is\nlimited to the main metabolic pathways involved. The roles of\nother metabolic pathways, such as cholesterol metabolism, and\nsome immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) and CD4+ T cells,\nare still unclear, and the role of metabolic reprogramming in\nimmune cells remains to be explored. NK cells can exert cytotoxic\neffects without antigen pre-sensitization, but some metabolic\nfeatures in the TME hinder NK cell immunotherapy [228]. NK cell\ndysfunction may be induced by lactate accumulation [229] and\ncompetitively inhibited by the active consumption of vitamin B6\nin PDAC [230].\nRecently, the link between the microbiome and PDAC has\nattracted considerable interest [231, 232] and may be useful for\nPDAC detection [233, 234]. Several microorganisms that act on the\nadenosine pathway have been found to enhance the efﬁcacy of\nimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) [235]. The expression of genes\ninvolved in the polyamine and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways,\nwhich are strongly correlated with host tumorigenesis and can\nserve as predictive markers for the early detection of PDAC, has\nbeen shown to be signiﬁcantly elevated [236]. Recent research has\nsuggested that the microbiome-derived metabolite trimethyla-\nmine N-oxide (TMAO) may be a driver of antitumour immunity\n[237] and that microbiota-derived 3-IAA can inﬂuence chemother-\napy efﬁcacy [238]. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor in TAMs can be\nactivated by tryptophan-derived microbial metabolites to sup-\npress antitumour immunity [239]. The role of intratumoural\nbacteria in PDAC requires further study due to their ability to\nmodulate the host immune system and metabolize drugs\n[240, 241].\nThe metabolic regulatory role of small extracellular vesicles\n(sEVs), such as exosomes, as intercellular communication media-\ntors in tumours should not be ignored [242, 243]. Pancreatic\ncancer-derived extracellular vesicles may inﬂuence lipolysis to\ninduce cancer-related cachexia [244]. The detection of sEVs based\non lectin-glycan interactions has potential as an early diagnostic\nmarker [245]. Exosomes derived from the tumour microenviron-\nment can also mediate cancer cell metabolism [246].\nMETABOLISM OF THE BODY\nIn addition to local metabolic reprogramming in tumours,\nsystemic metabolism can also serve as a potential pathogenic\nmechanism and therapeutic target [247]. A large-scale database\nstudy showed that obesity is associated with various cancers [248].\nObesity and diabetes are increasingly recognized as risk factors for\nPDAC, not only because of the remodelling of the tumour\nmicroenvironment but also because of their effects on systemic\nmetabolism [249, 250].\nMetabolic syndrome (MetS), a pathological condition character-\nized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and\nhyperlipidaemia, is associated with the risk of PDAC [251]. In the\nsetting of diet-induced hyperinsulinaemia and obesity, insulin\ndose-dependently increases the formation of acinar to ductal\nmetaplasia via trypsin and the insulin receptor (InsR) [252]. Stress\nadaptation through phase-separated organelle stress granules\n(SGs) mediates the development of PDAC, and obesity may be a\ndriving force behind this process [253]. At the same time, obesity\nand diabetes are also important factors leading to chemotherapy\nresistance [254]. Studies have shown that metformin increases the\nsensitivity of PDAC cells to gemcitabine [255], suggesting the\ndevelopment of new therapies [256]. Clinical trials using related\ndrugs for the treatment of PDAC have been carried out and will be\nlisted later.\nThere are already many forms and mechanisms of dietary\nintervention for cancer [257]. However, there is still a long way to\ngo before clinical application. We list several dietary intervention\nmodels in Text Box S4.\nIn addition to diet, physical exercise may reduce the progres-\nsion of cancer [258]. Moreover, mild cold exposure activates\nbrown fat and hinders glycolysis-based metabolism in cancer cells\n[259]. Patients with PDAC often experience weight loss and\nskeletal muscle wasting [260]. Aerobic exercise can promote\nimmune mobilization and exert antitumour effects through the IL-\n15/IL-15Rα axis [261]. However, due to individual differences in\nbody constitution, caution must be used when applying dietary\nintervention and physical exercise in cancer treatment.\nCOOPERATION WITH OTHER ANTITUMOUR THERAPIES\nRadiotherapy\nAlthough there is some controversy regarding the survival beneﬁt\nof this technique, radiation therapy has been used to treat\nborderline resectable PDAC, providing the possibility of resection\n[262]. Additionally, metabolic changes in PDAC can cause radio-\nresistance [263].\nOverexpressed MUC1 enhances nucleotide metabolism, facil-\nitates radiation resistance, and is targeted effectively through\nglycolytic inhibition [264]. Multiple cholesterol synthesis-related\ngenes are associated with radio-resistance in cell lines [265]. Serine\nand glycine starvation can inhibit the antioxidant response,\nnucleotide synthesis, and the TCA cycle and has the potential to\nbecome a cancer radio-sensitization strategy [266].\nH. Wu et al.\n6\nCell Death and Disease  (2024) 15:553"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "Chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is the most commonly used systemic treatment.\nGemcitabine is a type of nucleoside analogue that can interfere\nwith DNA synthesis and block the cell cycle [267].\nGemcitabine-resistant\ncell\nlines\nexhibit\nincreased\naerobic\nglycolysis and reduced ROS levels [268, 269]. Organoid-based\nmetabolomic analysis revealed that PDAC with high glucose\nmetabolism levels is more resistant to chemotherapy and that\nGLUT1/ALDOB/G6PD axis inhibitors are promising pharmacologi-\ncal agents [270]. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) supports\nDNA replication and RNA production by regulating carbon ﬂux\nbetween nucleic acid synthesis and lipogenesis, where key\nenzymes such as ribulose 5-phosphate isomerase (RPIA) and\nribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase (RPE) are upregulated to main-\ntain cell proliferation [271]. Studies have shown that S100A11 can\nenhance transketolase (TKT) synthesis and promote PPP [272]. In\naddition, the acidic tumor microenvironment can activate the\nYAP/MMP1 axis, promote the transition of cell metabolism to PPP,\nand promote tumor progression [273]. Elevated G6PD expression\nis also an important factor leading to erlotinib resistance [274].\nShukla et al. showed that mucin 1 (MUC1) and hypoxia-inducible\nfactor 1α (HIF1α) increased deoxyCTP (dCTP) pools, thus inducing\nacquired resistance to gemcitabine through molecular competi-\ntion [275]. ARNTL2-mediated cellular glycolysis was shown to\nincrease sensitivity to erlotinib treatment through the activation of\nthe\nPI3K/AKT\nsignalling\npathway\n[276].\nStudies\nhave\nalso\nconﬁrmed that the ERK/E2F1 pathway can cause gemcitabine\nresistance [277]. In amino acid metabolism, glutamine may\ncontribute to gemcitabine resistance due to its role in controlling\nROS and activating mTOR [269]. A nutrient-deﬁcient environment\nmay\nhelp\nactivate\nthe\nRNA-binding\nprotein\nHuR,\nthereby\nupregulating\nisocitrate\ndehydrogenase\n1\n(IDH1)\nexpression,\nenhancing antioxidant defence, and leading to chemotherapy\nresistance [278]. Increased glutamine uptake caused by MUC5AC\noverexpression can cause gemcitabine resistance [279]. The\nupregulation\nof\nFASN\nexpression\ncan\ninduce\nendoplasmic\nreticulum stress and promote gemcitabine resistance by enhan-\ncing de novo lipid synthesis [92]. The inhibition of cholesterol\nsynthesis may also enhance the effect of anticancer therapy [280],\nand the use of lipid rafts characterized by Cav-1-cholesterol may\nbe a breakthrough therapeutic approach [281]. By targeting\nCRABP-II, lipid raft cholesterol accumulation can be reversed to\novercome drug resistance [282]. CD36 expression is correlated\nwith antiapoptotic protein expression and may protect PDAC cells\nfrom drug-induced cell death [283]. In addition, UBE2T can affect\nthe remodelling of pyrimidine metabolism and confer gemcita-\nbine resistance [284].\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy has gradually developed into a mature anti-\ntumour strategy, but its efﬁcacy in PDAC is limited [285]. Some\nstudies have attempted to predict the response to immunother-\napy based on metabolic characteristics [286]. Metabolic disorders\nof the immune system in the TME are expected to improve the\nefﬁcacy of metabolism-targeted anticancer strategies [287, 288].\nNucleotide metabolism provides genetic material and energy\nresources for immune system activation and proliferation [289].\nPurine analogues, such as released extracellular ATP or adenosine,\nactivate the purinergic and adenosine receptors of immune cells,\nthereby promoting or suppressing immune responses [290]. IFN\ntriggers cell cycle arrest in the S phase, resulting in insufﬁcient\nnucleotide pools and nucleoside efﬂux, and IFN combined with\nATR inhibitors can induce lethal DNA damage and decrease\nnucleotide biosynthesis, thereby limiting the growth of PDAC\n[291].\nUnderstanding the inﬂuence of metabolic regulation on the\nefﬁcacy of immunotherapy is still in its infancy. Modulating cell\nmetabolism via the autologous T cell adoptive transfer protocol\ncan promote the generation of T cells with a memory phenotype\nand improve their antitumour effect [292, 293]. Engineering\noncolytic viruses to express leptin can also enhance antitumour\nresponses by increasing FAO and OXPHOS [294]. PD-1 blockade\nimmunotherapy is a widely used therapy, but PDAC patients\nrespond poorly. Targeting glycolysis impacts the accumulation of\nPD-1+ TILs in PDAC preclinical models [295]. Activating the AMPK\nand mTOR pathways related to mitochondrial metabolism is also\nexpected to enhance the therapeutic effect of PD-1 blockers\n[296, 297].\nBased on the aforementioned immune-metabolic crosstalk, new\ntherapeutic targets have been investigated. For example, indo-\nleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which can degrade tryptophan\nand inhibit immune responses [298], has been explored in several\nclinical studies, which we will describe below.\nOther therapies\nOther drug therapies are gradually being explored through\nemerging technologies [299]. The use of some nanomedicines\ncan enhance oxidative stress [300]. Reduction-responsive nano-\nplatforms that can regulate lipid metabolism and polarize\nmacrophages are available for the combined treatment of PDAC\n[301]. A novel dendrimer nanogel enhances chemoimmunother-\napy through endoplasmic reticulum stress [302]. After degrading\nthe ECM, nanoparticle transport can be enhanced, increasing the\nkilling effect on PDAC [303, 304]. Studies have shown that\nselenoorganic compounds and dihydroartemisinin can induce\nferroptosis in PDAC cells [305, 306]. Tailored ruthenium complexes\ncan also affect OXPHOS and exert anticancer effects [307].\nAlthough such investigations are still in the preclinical stage, they\nare providing new directions for the treatment of PDAC.\nCLINICAL TRIALS TARGETING METABOLISM\nMetabolic targeted therapy still has a long way to go before being\napplied as a routine treatment (Table 1). Some metabolic\nmodulators, such as metformin [308] and statins [309], have been\nused to exert additional cancer-treatment effects. Metformin can\naffect the malignant behaviour of SMAD4-deﬁcient PDAC cells by\ninhibiting HNF4G activity [310]; it can also destroy the dense\nmatrix by inhibiting PSC activity, signiﬁcantly improving the\ntherapeutic efﬁcacy of gemcitabine [311]. Several clinical trials of\nmetformin for the treatment of PDAC, such as NCT02048384,\nNCT03889795 and NCT02201381, have been carried out. Through\nin vivo metabolism tracking, it was found that statins can inhibit\nthe synthesis of coenzyme Q and that statins combined with MEK\ninhibitors can promote oxidative stress and apoptosis [312]. Based\non these promising data, phase I and II clinical trials, such as\nNCT00944463, NCT00584012 and NCT04862260, were conducted.\nIrbesartan may reverse gemcitabine resistance by inhibiting iron\nmetabolism\n[313].\nIn\naddition,\ndrugs\nsuch\nas\ndigoxin\n(NCT04141995),\ndapagliﬂozin\n(NCT04542291),\nomeprazole\n(NCT04930991), and even combinations of multiple metabolism-\nregulating drugs (NCT02201381) have been explored.\nClinical trials have begun to explore treatments based on the\nglycolytic pathway. In the case of NCT00096707, 2-deoxy-D-\nglucose (2-DG) combined with docetaxel was used for advanced\nsolid tumours and had tolerable adverse effects and certain\nclinical beneﬁts [314]. The lipoic acid analogue CPI-613 was shown\nto selectively inhibit PDH activity and inhibit the growth of PDAC\n[315]. In NCT01835041 and NCT03504423, CPI-613 was combined\nwith chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic PDAC, yielding\na good response rate [316].\nInducing metabolic crises through the antagonism of glutamine\ninhibitors, such as 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) and DRP-104,\nis a promising strategy in preclinical models [317]. NCT03965845\nexplored the efﬁcacy of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat\n(CB-839)\nin\nadvanced\nor\nmetastatic\nsolid\ntumours.\nIn\nH.

In recent years, in\nNCT01523808, NCT02195180, and NCT03665441, the combination\nof red blood cell-encapsulated asparaginase (such as GRASPA and\neryaspase) with chemotherapy has been shown to improve the\nprognosis of patients, indicating its great potential as a second-\nline treatment [318].

Both in vivo and in vitro experiments\nhave revealed the metabolic dependence of PDAC [322, 323]. The\nuse of stable isotopes has become a key method for exploring\nmetabolic pathways in PDAC [324]. Advanced technology plat-\nforms such as organoids are also promoting advancements in the\ntranslation of metabolism-related research [325]. Many molecular\nsubtyping methods based on metabolic characteristics are being\ndeveloped for the treatment and evaluation of different types of\nPDAC patients [270]. Moreover, the development of single-cell\nsequencing and spatial omics has made it possible to characterize\nthe metabolic crosstalk of different tissues at the cellular level\n[326]. Our understanding of the function of cellular metabolism in\ndisease progression has progressed signiﬁcantly (Fig. 2).\nGiven\nthat\nmost\nof\nthe\ncurrent\nunderstanding\nof\nhow\nmetabolism supports cell proliferation is based on studies in\ncancer cells, how metabolism shapes the interactions of different\ncells needs be explored in more complex ecosystems.

Recent studies have revealed the immunosuppressive characteristics of the PDAC tumor\nmicroenvironment (TME), including immune cells with suppressive properties, desmoplastic stroma,\nmicrobiome inﬂuences, and PDAC-speciﬁc signaling pathways. In this article, we review recent\nadvances in understanding the immunosuppressive TME of PDAC, TME differences among various\nmouse models of pancreatic cancer, and the mechanisms underlying resistance to immunotherapeutic\ninterventions. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of targeting cancer cell-intrinsic pathways and\nTME components to sensitize PDAC to immune therapies, providing insights into strategies and future\nperspectives to break through the barriers in improving pancreatic cancer treatment.\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), accounting for 90% of pan-\ncreatic tumors, remains a formidable malignancy with a dismal 5-year\nsurvival rate of merely 12%1. More than 80% of patients are diagnosed at an\nadvanced stage, either locally advanced or metastatic disease, rendering\ncurative surgical intervention futile2,3. Although gemcitabine in combina-\ntion with albumin-bound paclitaxel or modiﬁed FOLFIRINOX (5-ﬂuor-\nouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) has been established as the\nstandard ﬁrst-line chemotherapeutic protocol for metastatic cases2, the\nclinical median survival still falls short of 1 year4,5.\nCancer immunotherapeutic approaches, including immune check-\npointblockade(ICB),chimericantigenreceptor(CAR)T-celltherapies,and\ncancer vaccines, have achieved signiﬁcant advancements in treating various\ncancers6–8, such as melanoma, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and\nlymphoma9–12.\nHowever,\ntheir\neffectiveness\nin\nPDAC\nremains\ndisappointing6. Clinical studies utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors\n(ICIs), including anti-programmed death ligand-1 (anti-PD-L1) or anti-\ncytotoxic\nT-lymphocyte-associated\nprotein-4\n(anti-CTLA-4)\nmono-\nimmunotherapy and combination therapy, have not been successful in\ntreating pancreatic cancer13–15. In a recent phase 2 trial of metastatic PDAC,\ncombining ICIs (durvalumab and tremelimumab) with chemotherapy\n(gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) did not improve survival compared with\nchemotherapy alone16.\nThe immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in PDAC, a\nmajor factor contributing to immunotherapy resistance, includes tumor-\ninﬁltrating immune-suppressive cells, stromal cells, the microbiome, and the\nextracellular matrix (ECM). The immune inﬁltration in PDAC is character-\nized by an abundance of suppressive cells, a deﬁciency of anti-tumor immune\ncells, and immune dysfunction17–19. Exploring combination strategies invol-\nving immunotherapy and agents tailored to target these TME characteristics\nhas emerged as a prominent area of research in pancreatic cancer.\nIn this article, we review recent advances in understanding the\nimmunosuppressive TME of PDAC, describe TME differences among\nvarious animal models, discuss the mechanisms of immune resistance\ninduced by TME and tumor cells, and summarize strategies aimed at\nimproving the efﬁcacy of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer.\nHighly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment\nin PDAC\nThe TME of PDAC consists of various immune-suppressive cells,\nincluding immunosuppressive myeloid cells, M2 macrophages, N2\n1Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, College of Biomedicine and Health, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei,\n430070, China. 2Shenzhen Institute of Nutrition and Health, Huazhong Agricultural University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518000, China. 3Department of Molecular\nand Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. 4Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan\nModern Agriculture, Genome Analysis Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural\nSciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518000, China. 5Department of Experimental Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,\nHouston, TX, 77030, USA. 6The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Houston Graduate\nSchool of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.\ne-mail: fyao@mail.hzau.edu.cn;\nlma4@mdanderson.org\nnpj Precision Oncology |   (2024) 8:199 \n1\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;"}, {"page_number": 2, "text": "neutrophils, mast cells, Th2 cells, regulatory T cells, and regulatory B cells\n(Fig. 1 and Table 1). On the other hand, there is notable dysfunction and\ndeﬁciency of anti-tumor immune cells, including CD8 + T cells, con-\nventional dendritic cells, natural killer cells, M1 macrophages, N1 neu-\ntrophils, and Th1 cells (Fig. 1 and Table 2).

In addition, the\nmicrobiome, stromal cells, and ECM modulate immune cell inﬁltration\nand function, contributing to the establishment of an immunosuppres-\nsive TME.\nImmunosuppressive myeloid cells\nSuppressive myeloid cells in the TME can be broadly categorized into\nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) comprising granulocytic\nMDSCs and monocytic MDSCs, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)\nderived from either the bone marrow or resident tissue macrophages6,20,\nFig. 1 | The immunosuppressive TME in PDAC. a Schematic representation of the\ninterplay among tumor cells,tumor-inﬁltratingimmune cells, and cancer-associated\nﬁbroblasts (CAFs) in the PDAC TME. Tumor cells and CAFs secrete chemokines\nand growth factors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),\ngranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CXCL2/5, and\nCXCL12 to recruit suppressive immune cells to tumor tissues. Pro-tumor immune\ncells contribute to the exhaustion of effector T cells and the activation of CAFs.\nActivated CAFs, in turn, support tumor growth through desmoplasia and\ninﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-6; in addition, they may cooperate with mast cells\nto promote tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Upregulation of immune\ncheckpoint molecules (e.g., PD-L1 and TIGIT) on tumor cells and immune cells, as\nwell as downregulation of MHC-I, contribute to T-cell dysfunction. b Pro-tumor\ncells include myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), M2 macrophages, N2\nneutrophils, regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells, mast cells, and Th2 cells.

These myeloid cells\nare recruited to the TME by various factors and attenuate anti-tumor T-cell\nresponses in PDAC21,22.\nMDSCs. MDSCs are a subset of anti-inﬂammatory, immunosuppressive\ncells, originating from immature myeloid cells under various patholo-\ngical conditions such as chronic inﬂammation, cancer, and autoimmune\ndisease23. In pancreatic cancer, MDSCs exert immunosuppressive\nfunctions and promote immune evasion through EGFR-MAPK-\ndependent upregulation of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells24. It has\nalso been reported that MDSCs deplete nutrition through arginase-1 and\nthe Xc- transporter, resulting in the downregulation of the T-cell\nreceptor (TCR) and restriction of T-cell activation6,25. In addition,\nMDSCs can promote regulatory T (Treg) cell induction in a cell-cell-\ndependent manner26,27. In an autochthonous PDAC model, depletion of\ngranulocytic MDSCs elevated CD8 + T-cell inﬁltration and increased\ntumor cell apoptosis28. Moreover, reducing MDSCs through loss or\ninhibition of CXCR2 mitigated tumor metastasis and conferred sensi-\ntivity to anti-PD-1 therapy, thus prolonging survival in mice with\npancreatic cancer29. Notably, a recent preclinical study by DePinho and\ncolleagues30 demonstrated that inhibition of chemokine receptors on\nMDSCs (by using a CXCR1/2 inhibitor) combined with modulation of\nT-cell immune checkpoints (by using a 41BB agonist and a LAG3\nantagonist) could reprogram the highly suppressive tumor immune\nmicroenvironment of pancreatic cancer. This approach led to durable\nresponses and survival beneﬁts in a mouse model of PDAC, suggesting a\npotential clinical strategy.\nTAMs. TAMs in the PDAC TME are characterized by an enrichment of\npro-tumor M2-like phenotypes and a relatively low presence of anti-\ntumor M1-like phenotypes19. The immune suppression mediated by\nthese pro-tumor TAMs stems from their ability to hamper the anti-tumor\nactivity of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes by supporting PD-L1\nexpression in tumor cells and depleting nutrition in T cells24,27,31. More-\nover, TAMs hinder adaptive immune responses through the dectin-1/\ngalectin-9 axis32 and facilitate the production of immunosuppressive\nfactors in tumor cells, such as CXCL1 and CXCL5, through elevated\nexpression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)33.\nIn PDAC models, reprogramming TAMs through the blockade of\nreceptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIP1) leads to\nactivation of cytotoxic T cells and differentiation of T helper(Th) cells into a\nmixed Th1/Th17 phenotype34. Previous studies have revealed the pro-\ntumor effects of Th2 cells and the anti-tumor effects of Th1 cells34,35. While\nthe precise function of combined Th1/Th17 phenotypes remains to be\ndeﬁned in tumors, they appear to possess signiﬁcant immunogenicity and\nare associated with the downregulation of FOXP3, a biomarker of Treg\ncells34. Interestingly, an exosome-based dual delivery biosystem, featuring\nelectroporation-loaded galectin-9 siRNA and surface modiﬁcation with an\noxaliplatin prodrug, effectively reversed M2-like phenotypes of TAMs and\nenhanced anti-tumor immunity in mice36. In addition to their role in\nimmune suppression, TAMs support cancer cells by secreting growth fac-\ntors such as TGF-β37,38 and producing cytokines and chemokines that\naccelerate tumor metastasis directly or indirectly39–41.\nA study comparing immune inﬁltrates in pancreatic cancer and mel-\nanoma identiﬁed VISTA (V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell\nactivation) as a potential immune checkpoint primarily expressed on\nCD68+ macrophages in PDAC42. Targeting VISTA-positive macrophages\nholds promise as a strategy to augment CD8 + T-cell responses and treat\npancreatic cancer. Furthermore, a recent preclinical study demonstrated\nthat dual antagonism of CCR2 and CCR5 (CCR2/5i), when combined with\nradiation therapy and an anti-PD-1 antibody, resulted in a reduction in\ntumor inﬁltration by Tregs, M2-like TAMs, and MDSCs43. Notably, this\ncombinationtreatment increased intratumoraleffector and memoryT cells,\nsupporting the clinical development of CCR2/5i in combination with\nradiation therapy and ICB for the treatment

Neutrophils are major players in innate immunity. A single-cell\nRNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis uncovered a terminally differentiated\nsubpopulation of TANs exhibiting hyperactivated glycolysis and pro-\ntumor functions in PDAC, which is associated with unfavorable prog-\nnosis in patients44. Pro-tumor neutrophils secrete immunosuppressive\ncytokines and chemokines, thereby inhibiting the activity of cytotoxic\nCD8 + T cells45. Moreover, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have\nbeen reported to contribute to immunotherapy resistance induced by\nTANs. One of the inducers of NETs, IL17, which is upregulated in PDAC,\nrecruits neutrophils while excluding cytotoxic CD8 + T cells from\ntumors46.In preclinical mouse models, targeting TANs with lorlatinib has\nbeen shown to enhance the response to PD-1 blockade, highlighting the\npotential of modulating pro-tumor neutrophils in the TME as a treat-\nment strategy for PDAC47.\nAside from primary tolerance, the replenishment of TANs is a con-\ntributing factor to therapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. Targeting\nCCR2+ macrophages led to a compensatory inﬂux of CXCR2+ TANs, a\nphenomenon associated with poor outcomes in PDAC patients; interest-\ningly, dual inhibition of CCR2+ TAMs and CXCR2+ TANs signiﬁcantly\nimproved anti-tumor immunity and chemotherapeutic responses in\northotopic models of PDAC48. Similar to the plasticity of TAMs, recent\nstudies have revealed the plasticity of TANs—the presence of both N1 and\nN2 phenotypes in the TME of PDAC patients. The N1/N2 ratios positively\ncorrelated with CD8 + T-cell inﬁltration, median overall survival (OS), and\nrecurrence-free survival, and inversely correlated with the abundance of\ntumor-inﬁltratingTregs49.InmousemodelsofPDAC,blockadeoftheTGF-\nβ1 receptor promoted the polarization of neutrophils into an anti-tumor N1\nphenotype, thus enhancing the response of tumors to the combination\ntreatment with irreversible electroporation (which ablates tumors by\ninducing irreversible membrane destruction of cells) and anti-PD-150.\nMast cells. Mast cells, like neutrophils and macrophages, originate from\nmyeloid progenitor cells. Compared with normal tissues, PDAC tissues\nexhibit a signiﬁcant increase in inﬁltration by mast cells, which promote\nthe proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells and contribute to\nchemotherapy resistance51–54. The exact role and mechanisms by which\nmast cells regulate tumor immunity in PDAC are not fully understood.\nNevertheless, it is worth noting that in preclinical models of melanoma,\ncombining anti-PD-1 therapy with the depletion of mast cells resulted in\ntumor regression55, suggesting that mast cells may suppress the immune\nresponse and limit the efﬁcacy of immunotherapies.\nTreg cells\nTregcellsareaspecializedsubsetofTcellsthatmodulateeffectorTcells.The\nabundance of FOXP3+ Treg cells within pancreatic tumors increases\nduring PDAC progression and correlates with poor survival56–58. The\nimmunomodulatory effect of Treg cells has been studied in different\nmodels59,60. Bar-Sagi and colleagues61 reported that Treg cells inhibit the\nfunction of dendritic cells through direct contact, leading to the down-\nregulation of dendritic cell-derived costimulatory ligands that are crucial for\nCD8 + T-cell activation in PDAC. This study also demonstrated that the\nelimination of Treg cells induced an effective anti-tumor immune response\nin mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic tumors derived from a KPC model\n(expressing mutant forms of Kras and Trp53)61. On the other hand, how-\never, Pasca di Magliano and colleagues62 reported that the removal of Treg\ncells accelerated tumor progression by reprogramming cancer-associated\nﬁbroblasts in genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC. The con-\nﬂictingresultsfromorthotopicandautochthonousmodelsindicatecontext-\ndependent crosstalk between Tregs and other cell types in pancreatic\ncancer TME.\nB cells\nPlasma cells, a subtype of terminally differentiated B cells, play an essential\nrole in amplifying anti-tumor immune responses through antibody pro-\nduction. However, in PDAC patients and tumor-bearing mice, cancer can\ninduce differentiation of naïve B cells into regulatory B cells (as opposed to\nplasma cells) through Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling, which results\nin a reduction in tumor-inﬁltratingcytotoxic T cells, thereby contributing to\nimmune evasion63,64. In addition, BTK induces the programming of T(H)2-\ntype macrophages and diminishes CD8 + T-cell cytotoxicity by facilitating\nthe communication between B cells and TAMs in PDAC65. Furthermore,\nextensive research has advanced the understanding of the mechanisms of\nimmunosuppression induced by B cells and IL-3563,66–69. Targeting B cells\nthrough molecular blockade has shown promise in reducing tumor growth\nand disease progression, presenting a therapeutic strategy for treating\nPDAC in combination with immunotherapy63–65,68–71.\nStromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM)\nPDAC is characterized by extensive desmoplasia, where ﬁbroblasts are the\nmajor cell type72. A subset of ﬁbroblasts (myoﬁbroblasts), along with tumor\ncells and macrophages, can produce a dense ﬁbrotic matrix composed of\nECM proteins, thereby inﬂuencing the progression of PDAC and its\nresponse to treatment73–75. The excessive desmoplastic stroma limits the\npenetration of tumors by drugs and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells76. Addressing\nthis challenge, enzymatic degradation of hyaluronic acid (HA) has been\nshown to alleviate desmoplastic pressure. This approach not only expands\nthe microvasculature but also contributes to a 2-fold increase in overall\nsurvivalinmousemodelswhencombinedwithchemotherapy77,78.Inhuman\nPDAC tissues, elevated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity correlates with\nincreased ﬁbrosis and poor CD8 + T-cell inﬁltration79. Treatment with a\nFAK inhibitor led to a reduction in ﬁbrosis and tumor-associated immu-\nnosuppressive cells, sensitizing the p48-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53ﬂox/+\nmouse model of PDAC to T-cell immunotherapy and immune checkpoint\ninhibitors79. Furthermore, combining HA degradation with FAK inhibition\npromoted the survival of PDAC-bearing mice treated with an anti-PD-1\nantibody80; notably, this combination treatment enhanced T-cell inﬁltration\nwhile concurrently reducing MDSCs.\nBesides producing dense ECM, CAFs interact with immune cells and\ninduceimmunesuppressionthroughsecretedfactorssuchasIL-6,CXCL12,\ngranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and mac-\nrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)81,82. The removal of CAFs\nexpressing ﬁbroblast activation protein (FAP) has been shown to inhibit\ntumor growth and enhance the efﬁcacy of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1\nantibodies in mouse models of PDAC83. On the other hand, however,\ndepletion of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive CAFs hampers\nimmune surveillance, leading to an increase in Treg cells and shorter sur-\nvival in mice with PDAC84. Taken together with other studies73,74,85–87, these\nﬁndings underscore the functional heterogeneity of CAFs. CAFs can be\nclassiﬁed into inﬂammatory CAFs (iCAFs), αSMA + myoﬁbroblasts\n(myCAFs), and antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), with a small subset of\nCAFs being derived from pancreatic stellate cells74,87,88. While apCAFs\nsupport immune evasion by inducing expansion of Treg cells89, the pro-\ntumor role of iCAFs is associated with the cytokine IL-6, which suppresses\nanti-tumor immunity by eliciting metabolic stress and dendritic cell\napoptosis90,91. Moreover, induction of iCAFs by IL-17A-producing\nCD8 + T cells promotes PDAC progression and is associated with a poor\nprognosis92. myCAFs are the major source of type I collagen in the PDAC\nstroma, and depletion of type I collagen leads to upregulation of Cxcl5 in\ntumor cells, which promotes the recruitment of MDSCs and dysfunction of\nCD8 + T cells, thereby accelerating pancreatic cancer progression and\ndecreasing survival93. Intriguingly, whereas intact type I collagen triggers\ndegradation of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) and impedes PDAC,\nmatrix-metalloprotease-cleaved type I collagen promotes PDAC growth by\nactivating the DDR1–NF-κB–NRF2 axis94.\nStroma-modulating drugs have shown the potential to enhance the\nefﬁcacy of ICB therapy in preclinical models of PDAC. For instance,\ncombination treatment with the sonic hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine and\nthe chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel increased the inﬁltration of\nCD8 + T cells into tumors. A synergistic effect of this combination with\nanti-PD-1 therapy was observed in both orthotopic and genetically\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-024-00681-z\nReview article\nnpj Precision Oncology |   (2024) 8:199 \n6"}, {"page_number": 7, "text": "engineered mouse models of PDAC76. More recently, the combination of\nMEK inhibitor (MEKi) with STAT3 inhibitor (STAT3i) demonstrated\npromising results in mitigating the polarization of iCAFs and enriching\nCAFs with mesenchymal stem cell-like features. The resulting stroma\nremodeling facilitated the M2-to-M1 reprogramming of TAMs, improved\nthe trafﬁcking of CD8 + T cells, and impeded the inﬁltration of myeloid\ncells95. When the MEKi + STAT3i combination was added to anti-PD-1\ntreatment, prolonged survival was observed in PDAC-bearing mice com-\npared with anti-PD-1 treatment alone. These ﬁndings suggest that targeting\nthe stromal components holds promise as a strategy to overcome immu-\nnotherapy resistance in PDAC. The exploration of stroma-modulating\ndrugs in combination with immunotherapies may pave the way for\nimproved treatment outcomes.\nMicrobiome\nRecent studies have implicated the microbiome in the pathogenesis and\nimmunesuppressioninPDAC96,97.Thegutmicrobiomecantranslocateinto\npancreatic cancer tissues, modulating the tumor microbiome and altering\nthe immune landscape of TME97,98 (Fig. 2). Ablation of the gut microbiome\nby oral antibiotics has been shown to reverse the immunosuppressive TME.\nThis reversal is characterized by an increase in anti-tumor interferon-γ-\nproducing T cells, Th1 cells, and M1 macrophages, as well as a decrease in\npro-tumor IL-17a- and IL-10-producing T cells and MDSCs, thereby\nenhancing the efﬁcacy of ICB therapy97,99. Moreover, fungus-dependent IL-\n33 secretion by PDAC cells plays a role in recruiting and activating Th2 cells\nand innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2)100; these cells, in turn, contribute to\nimmune suppression by secreting pro-tumorigenic cytokines. In addition,\npathogenic fungi can promote PDAC progression via a mannose-binding\nlectin (MBL)–C3 axis96. It has also been reported that compared with\nhealthy individuals, Proteobacteria, Synergistetes, and Euryarchaeota are\nenriched in PDAC patients, reprograming TAMs toward a pro-tumor M2-\nlike phenotype through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling97. Intriguingly,\nLactobacillus metabolization of dietary tryptophan fosters TAM polariza-\ntion toward an immune-suppressive phenotype through the aryl hydro-\ncarbon receptor, accelerating PDAC progression101.\nCollectively, these ﬁndings highlight the complex relationship between\nthe microbiome and the immune response in PDAC, opening up potential\navenues for therapeutic interventions. For instance, the delivery of gut\nmicrobiome-derivedmetabolitetrimethylamineN-oxide(TMAO)hasbeen\nshown to enhance anti-tumor immunity and restrain tumor growth in\northotopic models of PDAC. When combined with anti-PD-1 therapy,\nTMAO delivery led to a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor burden and pro-\nlonged survival compared with treatment with TMAO or ICB alone102. In a\nstudy led by McAllister and colleagues98, analysis of the tumor microbiome\nin PDAC patients by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed higher\nmicrobial diversity in patients with longer survival. Notably, human-to-\nmicefecalmicrobiotatransplantsfromcontrol,long-termsurvival,orshort-\nterm survival donors differentially modulated the tumor microbiome,\ntumor growth, and tumor immune inﬁltration98. Furthermore, a metage-\nnomic analysis uncovered speciﬁc microbiome species associated with\nPDAC, including enrichment of Streptococcus and Veillonella spp and\ndepletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii103. This study suggests that\nmicroorganisms could serve as potential sources of biomarkers for pan-\ncreatic cancer. It should be noted that recent re-analyses of previously\nreported pan-cancer microbial composition data have identiﬁed signiﬁcant\npitfalls, including contamination, false positive classiﬁcations, problematic\nhandling of batch effects, and limitations in the machine learning approa-\nches used104, which warrant corrections and future improvement.\nImmune features of PDAC metastases\nThe liver and lung are the common sites of metastasis in patients with\nPDAC105,106. In general, patients with liver metastases have a poorer prog-\nnosis compared with those with lung metastases, indicating inherent dis-\nparities between these metastatic sites105,106. In mouse models of metastatic\nPDAC, signiﬁcant differences were observed in the TME between the liver\nand the lung: whereas the liver exhibited immunosuppressive character-\nistics,the lungTMEshowed highlevelsof immune inﬁltrationand activated\nimmune signaling105. Using cytometry by time-of-ﬂight, Jaffee, Fertig, and\ncolleagues analyzed a mouse model of metastatic PDAC and found a\nreduction in dendritic cells, NK cells, cytotoxic T cells, and Th cells in the\nTME of liver metastases relative to those present in lung metastases105.\nMoreover, signiﬁcant enrichment of PD-L1 and LAG3 was observed in the\nhepatic TME, along with higher levels of pro-tumorigenic chemokines such\nas CCL5, CCL22, and CXCL12 relative to the lung. In contrast, immune-\nactivating chemokines, such as CXCL9 and CXCL10, were found to be\nenriched in lung metastases relative to liver metastases105.\nA recent investigation of patient samples revealed signiﬁcant immune\nheterogeneity in PDAC recurrences across various sites including the liver,\nlung, peritoneum, and local areas106.

Furthermore, JAK-STAT–dependent\nmacrophage-ﬁbroblast crosstalk was reported to facilitate liver metastatic\noutgrowth in PDAC. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 or\nmyoﬁbroblastic metastasis-associated ﬁbroblast (myMAF)-speciﬁc genetic\ndepletion of STAT3 restored anti-tumor immunity and reduced liver\nmetastases109.\nTME differences among various mouse models of\npancreatic cancer\nPatient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, syngeneic mouse models, and\ngenetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are widely used in pan-\ncreatic cancer research and preclinical drug testing110. It is important to\nrecognize that these models exhibit distinct TMEs, necessitating careful\nselection based on the speciﬁc experimental objectives in preclinical studies.\nMoreover,thereisacriticalneedtoemphasizecomparativevalidationacross\nmultiple models to ensure the robustness and reproducibility of ﬁndings.\nCell line-derived xenograft and PDX models of pancreatic cancer are\nwidely used for gene function studies and evaluation of therapeutic\napproaches111. These models are categorized based on the implantation site\ninto orthotopic and subcutaneous models. Subcutaneous models facilitate\nnon-surgical implantation of tumor cells or tissue fragments, whereas\northotopic models, despite being more technically challenging to establish,\nbetter recapitulate tumor growth in the natural tissue microenvironment\ncompared with subcutaneous models. It is important to note that PDX\nmodels require immunodeﬁcient mice (typically nude mice, SCID mice, or\nNOD-SCID mice) to prevent immune rejection of human-derived xeno-\ngrafts. However, this immunodeﬁciency limits their utility for studying the\nimmune cell composition of tumors or evaluating immunotherapy efﬁcacy.\nAddressing this limitation, humanized mouse models have been developed\nfor immunotherapy studies. For example, Chang and colleagues112 isolated\nCD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from human umbilical cord blood and\ninjected them into 3- to 4-week-old NSG mice to establish a humanized\nmodel. Treatment with siRNA nanoparticles targeting PD-L1 upregulated\ninterferon-γ-positive CD8 + T cells and inhibited pancreatic tumor growth\nin this model, underscoring the potential of humanized PDAC PDX models\nfor advancing immunotherapy research.\nSyngeneic mouse models of PDAC involve implanting immunologi-\ncally compatible cancer cells or tissues into mice with an intact immune\nsystem, which distinguishes them from xenograft models. These models can\nalso be established through subcutaneous or orthotopic implantation110.\nOrthotopic tumors actively interact with the tissue microenvironment,\nproviding a more physiologically relevant model. However, due to the\ntechnical challenges associated with orthotopic models, subcutaneous\nmodels remain commonly used in preclinical drug trials. It should be noted\nthat cellline-or model-dependenteffectsareoftenobserved.For example,in\na study investigating the potential of a CD47 monoclonal antibody to\nenhancetheresponseofPDACtoICIs,combinationtherapytargetingCD47\nand PD-L1 showed synergistic inhibition of tumor growth in the Panc02 but\nnot in the MPC-83 syngeneic mouse model113. This indicates that treatment\nresponses may vary between models derived from different PDAC cell lines.\nscRNA-seq analysis revealed that anti-CD47 treatment reshaped the intra-\ntumorallymphocyteandmacrophagepopulationsinPanc02tumor-bearing\nmice, resulting in increased intratumoral CD8 + T cells, more active T-cell\nclusters,enhancedanti-tumorpro-inﬂammatorymacrophages,andreduced\nanti-inﬂammatorymacrophages113.Theseﬁndingsunderscorethesuitability\nof speciﬁc syngeneic models with intact immune systems for investigating\nthe intratumoral immune microenvironment and conducting preclinical\ntrials of immunotherapy.\nGEMMs allow immunocompetent mice to spontaneously develop\npancreatic cancer, eliminating the need for exogenous implantation\nmethods. They have become indispensable for evaluating various ther-\napeutic strategies111. Among these models, the LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53ﬂox/\nﬂox;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) model is a commonly used GEMM capable of gen-\nerating spontaneous pancreatic tumors that closely mimic human PDAC,\nwith features including prominent connective tissue hyperplasia, abnormal\nvascular distribution, and high metastatic potential. These tumors also\nexhibit extensive inﬁltration of immunosuppressive macrophages and low\nnumbers of effector T cells110. Studies on KPC mice have demonstrated that\nCD40 activation induces tumor regression through a T-cell-independent\nmechanism. This ﬁnding aligns with histological analyses of human tumors\ntreated with a combination of CD40 agonists and gemcitabine. However,\nthese results differ from those observed in the implantable KPC model114,115,\nsuggesting that GEMMs may be more similar to humans in terms of the\nTME and the mechanisms of immunotherapy response. This highlights the\nimportance of model selection.\nIn conclusion, various PDAC mouse models exhibit signiﬁcant dif-\nferences in TME and response to immunotherapy. For preclinical experi-\nments, selecting models with intact immune function, tumor pathological\nfeatures, and microenvironments similar to those of humans is important\nfor studying pancreatic carcinogenesis, metastasis, and immunotherapeutic\nstrategies.\nPancreatic cancer cell-intrinsic factors contributing to\nimmunotherapy resistance\nIn addition to the immunosuppressive TME of PDAC cells, tumor-intrinsic\nfeatures also contribute to immune evasion (Fig. 3). KRAS mutations are\npresent in more than 95% of PDAC116, among which the major mutations\nare G12D (40%), G12V (33%), and G12R (15%)117 (Fig. 3a). Downstream\nsignaling pathways and metabolic networks in mutant KRAS (mKRAS)-\ndriven tumors play a pivotal role in immune suppression and tumor\nprogression116,117. For instance, mKRAS leads to upregulation of CXCL1,\nCXCL5, and GM-CSF through NF-κB, PI-3K, or MAPK pathways, fos-\ntering the proliferation, maturation, and recruitment of immunosuppres-\nsive myeloid cells33,118,119. Moreover, mKRAS boosts PD-L1 expression on\ntumor cells through p38and MAPK pathways, thereby activating the PD-1/\nPD-L1 checkpoint and causing T-cell exhaustion24,120. In addition, mKRAS\nmodulates the tumor cell metabolism, increasing glucose uptake, and\naerobic glycolysis, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species\n(ROS)121,122. ROS, in turn, mediates mKRAS-induced PD-L1 expression\nthrough FGFR1 signaling122. It has also been shown that mKRAS recruits\nimmunosuppressive IL-17-producing T cells35 and promotes the formation\nand maintenance of ﬁbro-inﬂammatory stroma123.\nActivation of WNT signaling is often observed in pancreatic\ncancer124,125 (Fig. 3b). In PDAC, WNT pathway activation is associated with\nthe aberrant expression of WNT ligands. Moreover, a subset of PDAC\ntumors carry mutations in RNF43, whichencodesring ﬁnger 43, a ubiquitin\nligase that inhibits WNT signaling by ubiquitinating FZD receptors and\nLRP5/6 co-receptors, leading to their internalization and lysosomal\ndegradation126,127. The loss of RNF43 in a genetically engineered mouse\nmodel of PDAC accelerated tumor progression and upregulated regulatory\nT-cell immune checkpoint molecules, which could be a potential\nmechanism of immune evasion128. In addition, lncRNA-mediated inhibi-\ntion of β-catenin degradation has been observed in pancreatic cancer\ncells129,130. Although current evidence indicates that WNT pathway activa-\ntion is immunosuppressive in PDAC, the role of WNT–β-catenin signaling\nin regulating cancer immunosurveillance may be cancer-type-dependent131.\nIn addition to KRAS mutation and RNF43 loss, downregulation of\nmajor histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) contributes to immune\nevasion and immunotherapy resistance due to impaired antigen presenta-\ntion. Kimmelman and colleagues132 demonstrated that in pancreatic cancer\ncells, an autophagy-dependent mechanism, involving the autophagy cargo\nreceptor NBR1, targets MHC-I molecules for lysosomal degradation. A\nsubsequent study revealed that progranulin from tumor cells (not macro-\nphages) correlates with poor overall survival in PDAC. Inhibition of pro-\ngranulineffectivelyhaltedautophagy-dependentdegradationofMHC-Iand\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-024-00681-z\nReview article\nnpj Precision Oncology |   (2024) 8:199 \n8"}, {"page_number": 9, "text": "restored MHC-I expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, antibody-\nbased progranulin blockade in a mouse model of PDAC impeded the\ninitiation and progression of tumors133. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sig-\nnaling was thought to suppress immunity by acting on immune cells134. In a\nrecent study, our laboratory uncovered a new role of GR as a transcriptional\nactivator of PD-L1 and a transcriptional repressor of MHC-I in pancreatic\ncancer cells135 (Fig. 3c). In preclinical models, either genetic depletion or\npharmacological inhibition of GR promoted the inﬁltration and effector\nfunction of cytotoxic T cells, leading to enhanced immune surveillance and\nsensitization of pancreatic tumors to ICIs135. These ﬁndings highlight GR\nsignaling in pancreatic cancer cells as a tumor-intrinsic mechanism of\nimmune suppression and suggest that therapeutic intervention targeting GR\nholds promise for improving the responsiveness of pancreatic cancer to\nimmunotherapy. Furthermore, it should be noted that p53, which is fre-\nquently altered in PDAC, has been shown to promote antigen processing\nand MHC-1 surface expression136,137. Both aspects of antigen presentation\nare downregulated in p53-null and p53-mutant cancer cells136,137.\nMetabolic enzymes have crucial roles in multiple aspects of cancer,\nincluding tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance.\nRecently, Sherman and colleagues138 reported that pancreatic cancer cell-\nintrinsic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2), a key player in the\nmalate-aspartate\nshuttle,\nremodels\nTME\nto\nsuppress\nanticancer\nimmunity138. Mechanistically, GOT2 promotes the transcriptional activity\nof nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta\n(PPARδ) to restrict CD4+ and CD8 + T-cell inﬁltration of the TME,\nrevealing a non-canonical function for this metabolic enzyme138. Moreover,\nZhangand colleagues139 showed thatdeﬁciencyinquinoid dihydropteridine\nreductase orchestrates a series of events culminating in the recruitment of\nMDSCs, which ultimately induce immunosuppression in PDAC. In addi-\ntion, pancreatic cancer cells can impair NK cell activity by competitively\ndepleting vitamin B6, thereby compromising anti-tumor immunity140.\nInterestingly, metabolism-focused CRISPR screens have identiﬁed genes\nlinked to immune evasion in PDAC, including Tap1, Tapbp, and the\nautophagy gene Atg7141. Furthermore, tumor cell-intrinsic deﬁciency in the\nepigenetic regulator SETD2 has been shown to promote tumor progression\nthrough two mechanisms: 1) by enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phos-\nphorylation through interactions with a subset of lipid-rich CAFs142, and 2)\nby boosting recruitment of immunosuppressive neutrophils through acti-\nvation of the PI3K-AKT pathway143.\nReprogramming cancer microbiome has been linked to immune\nevasion, particularly in PDAC. The collagen I (Col1) homotrimer produced\nby pancreatic cancer cells fosters oncogenic signaling by binding to α3β1\nintegrin, resulting in the development of a tumor microbiome abundant in\nanaerobic Bacteroidales in hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME144.\nDeleting Col1 homotrimers in a mouse model of PDAC yielded signiﬁcant\nbeneﬁts, including increased overall survival, enhanced T-cell inﬁltration,\nand improved responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy144.\nTherapeutic strategies and clinical trials of pancreatic\ncancer immunotherapies\nDespiteanumberofbreakthroughsinimmunotherapiesformultiplecancer\ntypes, their clinical utility in PDAC, whether administered as monotherapy\nor in combination with other therapies, has been insufﬁcient. Nevertheless,\nextensive preclinical studies and clinical trials have provided valuable\ninsights. In this section, we discuss three types of immunotherapeutic\nstrategies for pancreatic cancer treatment (Table 3): (i) targeting myeloid\nFig. 3 | Tumor-intrinsic signaling pathways associated with immune evasion\nin PDAC. a Mutated KRAS (mKRAS), which is permanently bound to GTP, con-\nstitutively activates downstream signaling pathways, resulting in PD-L1 over-\nexpression and the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells to pancreatic tumors.\nb Aberrant activation of the WNT–β-catenin pathway, which can be caused by\nmutation of RNF43 or lncRNA-mediated inhibition of β-catenin degradation,\nreduces dendritic cell recruitment by downregulating CCL4 and upregulatingPD-L1\nexpression. c Lipophilic glucocorticoids (GCs) diffuse through the cell membrane\nand bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the cytoplasm of PDAC cells. This\nbinding induces a change in the chaperone complex bound to GR, leading to its\ntranslocation into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, GR activates PD-L1 expression\nand represses MHC-1 expression by binding to glucocorticoid response elements\n(GREs), ultimately leading to the reduction in the abundance and effector function\nof tumor-inﬁltrating CD8 + T cells.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-024-00681-z\nReview article\nnpj Precision Oncology |   (2024) 8:199 \n9"}, {"page_number": 10, "text": "Table 3 | Clinical trials targeting immune cells or stroma in PDAC\nTarget\nTargeted therapy\nImmunotherapy\nChemotherapy or\nradiotherapy\nPhase\nNCT Number\nPatient population\nStatus/results\nMyeloid cell\nGB1275 (CD11b)\nPembrolizumab (PD-1)\nGemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel\n1\nNCT04060342\nUntreated advanced or\nmetastatic cancers\nincluding PDAC\nTerminated for no clear beneﬁt of GB1275\nIMC-CS4 (CSF-1R)\nPembrolizumab (PD-\n1), GVAX\nCyclophosphamide\n1\nNCT03153410\nPreviously treated borderline\nresectable or locally\nadvanced PDAC\nCompleted.

Targeting CD11b, CSF-1R, CCR2/\n5, and CXCR1/2 has emerged as therapeutic strategies.\nCD11b is an integrin molecule expressed on myeloid cells, playing a\nrole in chemotaxis and cellular functions. In preclinical studies, the\nadministration of a small-molecule agonist of CD11b led to a reduction in\nsuppressive myeloid cell inﬁltration and repolarization of TAMs toward an\nanti-tumor phenotype, thereby eliciting a T-cell response. This treatment\nalso showed an enhancement in the therapeutic effects of an anti-PD-1\nantibody145. However, a clinical trial (NCT04060342) investigating the\ncombination of the CD11b agonist (GB1275) with gemcitabine, nab-\npaclitaxel,andpembrolizumab(ananti-PD-1antibody)wasterminateddue\nto the lackof a clear beneﬁt in PDAC patients when GB1275 was used either\nas a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab146.\nIn an orthotopic model of PDAC, blocking CSF-1R not only reduced\nTAM inﬁltration but also reprogrammed TAMs to enhance T-cell activa-\ntion, resulting in increased efﬁcacy of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4147.\nUnfortunately, clinical trials combining an anti-CSF-1R antibody with\nimmunotherapy for PDAC treatment have not yielded satisfactory results\nthus far. For example, a phase 1a/b single-arm study combining the anti-\nCSF-1R antibody cabiralizumab with PD-1 blockade (nivolumab)\ndemonstrated discouraging outcomes with an objective response rate\n(ORR) of 6.0%, a median overall survival (OS) of 5.6 months, and a median\nprogression-free survival (PFS) of 1.7 months (NCT02526017)148.

Several formulations of agonistic CD40 antibodies have\nundergone testing in preclinical and clinical settings, demonstrating toler-\nability and feasibility. DeNardo and colleagues156 engineered a neoantigen-\nexpressingmousemodelofPDACandshowedthatenhancingdendriticcell\ninﬁltration and activity using FLT3 ligand along with an agonistic CD40\nantibody resulted in increased intratumoral CD8+ cells and prolonged\nsurvival when combined with radiation therapy. Currently, early-phase\nclinical trials are in progress, evaluating the combination of the agonistic\nCD40 antibody and FLT3 ligand with anti-PD-1, gemcitabine, and nab-\npaclitaxel for treating pancreatic cancer and other advanced cancers (e.g.,\nNCT03329950)158.\nDendritic cell vaccination has emerged as a strategy to enhance anti-\ntumor immunity159. In a syngeneic Panc02 model of pancreatic cancer,\ncombining dendritic cell-based vaccination with gemcitabine signiﬁcantly\nimproved the survival of tumor-bearing micecompared with vaccination or\ngemcitabine alone160. Moreover, the combination of an allogeneic tumor\nlysate-loaded dendritic cell vaccine with an agonistic CD40 antibody sig-\nniﬁcantly increased survival in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, which\nwas accompanied by an increase in CD8 + T-cell inﬁltration161. A recent\nphase 1 clinical trial involving 10 patients with resected PDAC demon-\nstrated the safety of an allogeneic tumor lysate-loaded autologous dendritic\ncell vaccine, with seven out of 10 patients showing no recurrence or pro-\ngression at a median follow-up of 25 months162. An ongoing phase 1 clinical\ntrial is evaluating the safety and efﬁcacy of a tumor lysate-loaded dendritic\ncell vaccine in combination with an agonistic CD40 antibody in patients\nwith\nmetastatic\nPDAC\nfollowing\nFOLFIRINOX\nchemotherapy\n(NCT05650918)163.\nTargeting B cells\nBTK-dependentcrosstalkbetweenBcellsandTAMshasbeenidentiﬁedasa\ndriver of PDAC growth. In mice bearing PDAC, the use of a BTK inhibitor\n(ibrutinib) led to the restoration of anti-tumor immunity, inhibition of\npancreatic tumor growth, and enhanced responsiveness to standard-of-care\nchemotherapy65. However, a phase 3 clinical trial combining ibrutinib with\ngemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel failed to show improvements in PFS and\noverall survival in PDAC patients compared with the placebo plus gemci-\ntabine/nab-paclitaxel cohort164. Meanwhile, the combined treatment with\nacalabrutinib (a second-generation BTK inhibitor) and pembrolizumab\nproduced modest clinical beneﬁts, with an ORR of 7.9% and a DCR of\n21.1%, compared with the 0% ORR and 14.3% DCR observed in the aca-\nlabrutinib monotherapy group165.\nReprogramming macrophages\nBeyond its role in activating conventional dendritic cells, CD40 activation\nhas been found to reprogram macrophages into tumoricidal TAMs in\nPDAC-bearing mice115. However, in a randomized phase 2 trial involving\n105 patients with PDAC, sotigalimab, an agonistic CD40 antibody, did not\ndemonstrate survival beneﬁts when combined with chemotherapy (gem-\ncitabine/nab-paclitaxel) and an anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab)166. Cur-\nrently, a phase 1 clinical trial is recruiting patients with metastatic PDAC to\nassess the response to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in combination with the\nanti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab plus nivolumab, hydroxychloroquine,\nor NG350A (a CD40 agonist) (NCT04787991)167. In addition to CD40\nagonism, the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2)\nantagonist has demonstrated the induction of T-cell-dependent repro-\ngramming of TAMs to be tumoricidal, reducing tumor burdens by\nenhancing phagocytosis in orthotopic models of PDAC168. A phase 1 trial\nevaluating the combination of the cIAP1/2 antagonist ASTX660 with the\nanti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab is recruiting patients with pancreatic\ncancer or other solid tumors (NCT05082259)169.\nCD47 expressed on tumor cells acts as a “don’t eat me” signal by\nengaging signal-regulating protein alpha (SIRPα) expressed on macro-\nphages, thereby blocking phagocytosis. This phagocytic checkpoint has\ngained attention as an attractive target for immunotherapy170. Given the\nsubstantial T-cell dysfunction and exhaustion observed in PDAC and other\n“cold” tumor types, macrophage-based therapeutic strategies have emerged\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-024-00681-z\nReview article\nnpj Precision Oncology |   (2024) 8:199 \n12"}, {"page_number": 13, "text": "to address resistance to T-cell-based immunotherapy21.

In preclinical\nmodels, the degradation of hyaluronan by PEGPH20 demonstrated a sig-\nniﬁcant survival beneﬁt when combined with gemcitabine77,78. In PDAC\npatients not selected for tumor hyaluronan status, the addition of PEGPH20\nto FOLFIRINOX led to increased toxicity and a reduced median OS\n(7.7 months compared with 14.4 months in the FOLFIRINOX alone\ngroup)172.Ontheotherhand,inarandomizedphase3clinicaltrialinvolving\npatients with hyaluronan-high metastatic PDAC, the combination of\nPEGPH20 with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel improved the ORR but did not\nincrease OS or PFS when compared with the placebo plus gemcitabine/nab-\npaclitaxel arm173. Currently, a phase 2 trial is evaluating the combination\ntreatmentwithPEGPH20andpembrolizumabinpatientswithhyaluronan-\nhigh metastatic PDAC (NCT03634332)174.\nIn a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC, the administration\nof an FAK inhibitor led to a reduction of ﬁbrosis and increased sensitivity to\nimmunotherapy (anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4)79. A phase 1 study\ndemonstrated that the combination of defactinib (a small-molecule inhi-\nbitorofFAK)withPD-1blockadeplusgemcitabineresultedinstabledisease\nin 11 out of 20 patients with metastatic PDAC175; this outcome was\naccompanied by an increase in CD8 + T cells and a decrease in Tregs,\nmacrophages, and stromal cells. Currently, a phase 2 trial is underway to\nevaluate the efﬁcacy of pembrolizumab plus defactinib following che-\nmotherapy as a neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment in patients with\nresectable PDAC (NCT03727880)176.\nCXCL12, produced by FAP+ CAFs, inhibits T-cell inﬁltration in\npancreatic cancer.

Of note, a recent phase\n2 trial assessing the combination of BL-8040 (a CXCR4 antagonist), pem-\nbrolizumab, and Onivyde (topoisomerase I inhibitor) demonstrated\nencouraging results, including an ORR of 32%, a DCR of 77%, and duration\nofresponse(DOR)of7.8monthsinpatientswithmetastaticchemotherapy-\nrefractory PDAC178.\nThe JAK-STAT pathway activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and\ninduces inﬂammatory CAFs, contributing to immunosuppression in\nPDAC81,87,179. In a phase 2 study of ruxolitinib, a small-molecule JAK1/JAK2\ninhibitor, in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent capecitabine,\nthere was no observed beneﬁt in OS generally, but a signiﬁcant increase in\nOS was noted in patients with systemic inﬂammation compared with the\nplacebo plus capecitabine group180. Unfortunately, two subsequent rando-\nmized phase 3 studies combining ruxolitinib and capecitabine for treating\nadvanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer showed no improvement in OS or\nPFS181. Currently, a phase 1 clinical trial combining ruxolitinib, retifanlimab\n(an anti-PD-1 antibody), and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) is recruiting\npatients with metastatic PDAC (NCT05440942)182.\nDiscussion\nBoth pancreatic cancer cell-intrinsic signaling pathways and the TME play\nsigniﬁcant roles in immune suppression, contributing to the inherent\nresistance of pancreatic cancer to immunotherapy. Various therapeutic\nstrategies, when combined with immunotherapy, have shown encouraging\nresults in preclinical studies. However, the translation of these ﬁndings into\nclinical beneﬁts has been challenging thus far. It is crucial to elucidate the\nmechanisms by which human PDAC evades immune surveillance and to\ndevise approaches that effectively overcome immunotherapy resistance in\npatients. It should be noted that unrestricted cell death or tissue damage\ninduced by chemotherapy might lead to an immunosuppressive TME183. In\ncontrast, radiation therapy was reported to enhance the response to\nimmunotherapy in patients with microsatellite-stable pancreatic cancer184.\nImproving pancreatic cancer immunotherapy involves exploring\nvarious strategies. Some key strategies and future perspectives include: (1)\ncombination therapies: combining different immunotherapeutic agents,\nincluding inhibitors of established and newly discovered immune check-\npoints, with targeted therapies or other immunomodulators, may enhance\nthe overall anti-tumor response. (2) Stroma-targeted approaches: targeting\nthe dense stroma in pancreatic cancer to reduce ﬁbrosis holds promise for\nimproving drug delivery and enhancing immune cell inﬁltration. (3) Vac-\ncine development: developing personalized cancer vaccines based on indi-\nvidual tumor proﬁles has the potential to stimulate a speciﬁc and robust\nimmune response against cancer cells. (4) Bispeciﬁc antibodies: designing\nantibodies that can simultaneously target multiple antigens is likely to\nenhance their speciﬁcity and efﬁcacy in engaging immune cells against\ncancer. (5) Adoptive cell therapies: CAR T-cell therapies, which use\ngenetically engineered T cells directed to speciﬁc cancer-associated antigens\nto elicit cytotoxic activity, represent a promising therapeutic modality,\nalthough signiﬁcant challenges exist for CAR T-cells to inﬁltrate the\nimmunosuppressive TME of pancreatic tumors. (6) Biomarker identiﬁca-\ntion: identifying reliable biomarkers to predict the response to immu-\nnotherapy will allow for betterpatient stratiﬁcation and treatment selection.\n(7) Clinical trial innovation: designing innovative clinical trials to test\nemerging therapies and combinations can ensure a rapid translation of\npromising preclinical ﬁndings into clinical beneﬁts.\nThese strategies are active areas of research and development, with the\npotential to signiﬁcantly impact the future of pancreatic cancer immu-\nnotherapy. In addition, investigating strategies for early detection of pan-\ncreatic cancer will enable timely intervention, potentially improving the\nsuccess of immunotherapeutic approaches.\nReceived: 1 April 2024; Accepted: 27 August 2024;\nReferences\n1.\nSiegel, R.
